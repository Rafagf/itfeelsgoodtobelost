										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Have you heard of the famous Shibuya crossing in Tokyo?</h3>
<p>The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo is rumoured to be the busiest intersection in the world. With more than 3000 people crossing it at peak times and coming from all directions at once, this place is any photographer&#8217;s dream. This is why it has become one of the most popular sightseeing attractions in Tokyo, especially at night, when the flashing lights make it simply special.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo has appeared in many movies, such as Lost in Translation, The Fast and the Furious or Resident Evil.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Japanese friend told me once that if you go to Tokyo and don&#8217;t cross it at least a few times you can&#8217;t really say you&#8217;ve been to Tokyo. I have to admit it looks hectic from outside, but from inside it feels really natural. It&#8217;s just one of many examples of how polite and organised is the Japanese culture and its people.</p>

<p>Everyone, including you, is waiting patiently for the green light. Once you step your foot down the zebra and follow the immense crowd, you realise that you participate in a live metaphor of the city- bursting with life and so crowded yet full of harmony and politeness. Thousands of people crossing in all directions within a few minutes and yet no one will bump into each other! Simply Zen.</p>
<p>We were a bit unlucky and spent a few very rainy days in Tokyo. With not much to do, we decided to come back to enjoy the rainy view from a Starbucks coffee on the second floor of a surrounding building. The sea of yellow umbrellas was just so cool.</p>

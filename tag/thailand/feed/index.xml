										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><strong>U</strong><b>pdated in 2023</b>: This post has been updated to ensure it contains the most accurate and comprehensive guide for exploring Koh Samet. Enjoy planning your adventure!</i></p>
<p>Embarking on an adventure exploring Koh Samet, a lovely island nestled in the Gulf of Thailand, is a perfect escape from the bustling city of Bangkok. This comprehensive travel guide will help you navigate through the island&#8217;s pristine beaches, amazing sunsets, and vibrant nightlife. Koh Samet is still a hidden gem, so make sure you explore this paradise before it becomes another crowded island!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are like us and made the mistake to spend some days in Pattaya&nbsp;you&#8217;ll find exploring Koh Samet a refreshing experience.<span id="more-68"></span></p>
<h3><strong>How to get there?</strong></h3>
<p>We went to Koh Samet from Pattaya. If you&#8217;re going from Bangkok, I&#8217;d expect there are buses from Ekkamai bus station to Ban Phe port. Worst scenario, you could easily go to Pattaya and then go to Ban Phe. This is how we did it from Pattaya:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to this <strong style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Praew+Souvenir+@Tesco+Lotus+Central+Pattaya/@12.9337661,100.9025029,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3102be1c9a4d3ec5:0xade9af5b32c85c66!2sPattaya+Bus+station!8m2!3d12.9499477!4d100.9033208!3m4!1s0x310295f03b6ec8e3:0x26063f5fe5264481!8m2!3d12.9337639!4d100.9034285">location</a></strong>. In front of the Tesco Lotus, there is a <b style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">small travel office that organizes trips by van.</b></li>
<li>Tell them you want to go to <strong>Ban-Phe port</strong> to then go to Koh Samet<b>.</b> The trip takes an hour and it costs 300 bahts (2 people).</li>
<li>Once in the port, walk to the ticket office. There are slow and fast boats. We took a fast boat, which after haggling a bit, cost us 250 bahts (2 people).</li>
<li>A short 15-minute ride later, you&#8217;ll arrive at Koh Samet. A coast guard will approach you to collect the national park fee, which is 200 baht. Rest assured, exploring Koh Samet is worth every penny!</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180318_144359-e1570995593904.jpg" alt="Ban Phe port" width="3120" height="2085"></p>
<h3><strong>How to move around</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The island is fairly small, but you&#8217;ll need transport to move around. Options are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hopping in big taxis that move around the island all day.</strong> The price depends on where you&#8217;re going but keep in mind they&#8217;re generally pricey.</li>
<li><strong>Rent a bike and cycle around!</strong> Ecological and cheap.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our favorite: hire a motorbike </strong>(250 bahts per day). Only for those who know how to drive. If you&#8217;re a beginner, you should be fine as it is quite easy to drive in Koh Samet. Drive safely!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A few things to convince you why exploring Koh Samet is worth it</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hat Sai Kaew Beach</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most popular beach. During the day expect a lot of people, towels, activities like snorkeling and so on.&nbsp; In the night the atmosphere is stunning: nice restaurants, fire shows, relaxed parties, locals hanging out&#8230;</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/koh-samet-bar.png" alt="Naga Bar" width="655" height="471"></h3>
<figure id="attachment_1153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1153" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/koh-samet-bar2.png" alt="Naga Bar Koh Samet" width="664" height="475"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1153" class="wp-caption-text">Naga Bar offers chilled atmosphere during the day and great party vibes at night</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>Ao Prao beach</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Simply</strong>&nbsp;<strong>paradise</strong>. Surrounded by resorts, but don&#8217;t let this put you off. The water is a stunning shade of blue and crystal clear, and the sand couldn&#8217;t be any whiter. We&#8217;ve visited quite a few beaches, and this is one of our favorites. Plus, we got to witness one of the most beautiful sunsets we&#8217;ve ever seen. Pictures simply don&#8217;t do it justiceâ€”you&#8217;ll have to go and see it for yourself!</p>
<figure id="attachment_84" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-samet2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Koh Samet is worth a visit" width="690" height="460"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-caption-text">This sunset alone shows Koh Samet is worth a visit</figcaption></figure>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/koh-samet-beach-day.jpg" alt="koh samet beach" width="4799" height="2887"></p>
<h3>Wat Koh Samet</h3>
<p>Buddism is an important part of the local culture, so if you want to experience that, the temple complex in the middle of the village called Wat Koh Samet is worth a visit. <strong>After climbing a few stars, you will find the famous big Buddha statue there.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_93" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93" style="width: 449px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-samet61-e1570995284982.jpg" alt="Koh Samet Wat" width="449" height="589"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-93" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure to stop on your way to visit the Big Buddha in Koh Samet Wat</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are a morning person <strong>you may be lucky to see monks walking down the streets and receiving alms</strong>, as the practice of offering food is called. Mothers have been cooking food for monks and giving alms since the dawn of Buddhism over 2,500 years ago!</p>
<figure id="attachment_92" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92" style="width: 3114px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180318_112606.jpg" alt="Monks in the morning" width="3114" height="2715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-92" class="wp-caption-text">Monks receiving alms in the morning</figcaption></figure>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-samet-2-e1570995952859.jpg" alt="Mrrrau" width="440" height="549"></p>
<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/stay-samed">Stay Samet</a></strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Looking for a budget-friendly accommodation option while exploring Koh Samet? Consider Stay Samet. They offer both shared and private rooms that are clean and comfortable. The on-site restaurant serves a variety of healthy and delicious food. The reception staff is friendly and always ready to assist with anything. Plus, the location is excellent, with many shops and restaurants nearby.</p>
<h4><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/samed-villa-resort">Samed Villa Resort</a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a more luxurious stay while exploring Koh Samet, consider Samed Villa Resort. This outstanding resort is located right in front of Ao Phai Beach, providing direct access to the beach. You can enjoy the best sunsets right from the resort! The rooms are stylish and clean, and don&#8217;t forget to indulge in their massage service!</p>
<h2>How to come back to Bangkok?</h2>
<p>All good comes to an end. Head to the pier and hop on the first departing boat to come back to the mainland<b>.</b> There are boats departing every hour. The slow one is 50 bahts and takes about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>There are buses heading to Bangkok </strong>at the bus station next to the pier<b>. </b>The price is 150 baths and the drop-off point is Ekkamai Bus Station.</p>
<p>To sum it up, exploring Koh Samet is an adventure worth undertaking, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have ever heard about a town called <strong>Poipet</strong>, the chances are you didn&#8217;t hear anything good about it. There are horror stories online about crossing the Cambodian border from Thailand (and the other way around) by this town. I&#8217;m not going to list them as the Internet is flooded with posts about it, but I&#8217;ll share our experience.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: It wasn&#8217;t as bad as they say it is!</strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Before crossing the Cambodian border</h2>
<p>We were in <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/05/26/koh-chang-a-hidden-paradise-of-thailand/"><strong>Koh Chang</strong></a>, an island on the Gulf of Thailand. We decided to travel to Cambodia, due to its proximity and to visit <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>, one of the most amazing monuments in the world.</p>
<p>While In Ko Chang, we stayed at <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><strong>Little Eden Bungalows</strong></a>, a beautiful backpackers bungalow resort, where we were offered transportation to Siem Reap (the city where Angkor Wat is) through an external Thai company. The receptionist recommended not do the whole trip with them and get a taxi as soon as we reached Cambodia. This way we would avoid scams like: &#8220;Sorry the bus is broken, you all need to get these expensive taxis waiting conveniently for you in this corner&#8221;.</p>
<p>We had also read online to not even complete the whole trip in Thai side with them. They would do a stop before crossing the Cambodian border in a restaurant a few kilometresÂ away, collecting everyone&#8217;s passports and forcing you to get the Cambodian visa through an unofficial office where you end up paying up to two times more!</p>
<p>The list of scams goes on and on, but we still decided to go for it. It was much cheaper and comfortable than coming all the way back to Bangkok and fly to Siem Reap.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: Don&#8217;t overread online about crossing the Cambodian border.Â </strong>YES, you need to do to make sure you read a bit to have everything under control. Once you&#8217;ve done that, stop reading. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be like me; worried to death the night before and asking yourself why on earth you would do something like that. IT WILL BE OK <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The CROSSING day</h2>
<p>In the morning, a mini-van picked us up at 7 AM. The guy didn&#8217;t seem very friendly, but who cares, right? After picking up some tourists we made it to the pier, where we waited 30 minutes for the ferry. 45 minutes later we had made it to the mainland.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-191 size-full" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/koh-chang101.jpg" alt="crossing the cambodian border: ready!" width="6000" height="4000" /></p>
<p>Back in the mini-van, we had a 3 hours drive ahead of us toÂ <strong>Aranyaprathet</strong>, the Thai town where the border is. Turned up the stories were right and the guys took us to a restaurant where we &#8220;<em>would have lunch before going to the visa office</em>&#8220;. We said <em>&#8220;nope, thank you, we&#8217;ll walk&#8221;,</em> got our luggage and started walking. We had read they could get pushy when doing this but they were totally ok with it.</p>
<p>At this point, it was recommended to get a Tuk Tuk to the border, as the town is supposed to be dangerous. We didn&#8217;t see any (plus they would try to take us to the &#8220;unofficial office&#8221; to scam us), so we just walked. The town wasn&#8217;tÂ <em>nice</em> but it didn&#8217;t feel dangerous either. Thai people taking care of their business and not a single person said anything to us. After 15 minutes we made it to the border. Happy times!</p>
<p>We were expecting long queuesÂ but it was clear we were way ahead than most of the tourists, which were probably stuck &#8220;having lunch&#8221;. In less than 10-15 minutes we had our leaving stamp in the passport and we were in Poipet, Cambodia.</p>
<p>Once there, some guys tried to help us out with our transport to Siem Reap as they &#8220;knew someone who could take us very cheap&#8221;. After ignoring them, we walked to the Visa Cambodian office where we would get our visa. Funny enough, we found again an empty office, full of Cambodian officers (around 10) and maybe 3-4 tourists. We filled up the requested documents, handed it to the officers along with a photo and&#8230;it was scam time again!</p>
<p><strong>The visa price is officially 30$</strong>, and even in the office, there is a big sign that says the same thing, 30$. We had read they would ask for more money and turned out to be right. The officer pointed to a very lame paper where we could read: <em>&#8220;30$ + 100 Baths&#8221;</em> (Bath is the Thai currency, 100 baths are about 3$). We said <em>&#8220;nope, it&#8217;s only 30$, is written there&#8221;</em>, but theÂ guy didn&#8217;t even blink and repeated &#8220;<em>100 Baths</em>&#8220;. We tried to make him understand but he left us no choice, so we gave him the 100 baths.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to avoid the scam wasn&#8217;t really about the money but about playing by the book. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have enough patience. If you hand out the 30$, sit and wait, after some time they will give you the visa. Who knows how long you will wait though.</p></blockquote>
<p>We walked a bit more and pass around a few casinos where Thai people gamble as it&#8217;s illegal in Thailand. Next step was to get the Cambodia entering stamp in our passport, which went quite smoothly. A random guy offered me a penÂ and of course, it turned out he knew a guy that would take us very cheap to Siem Reap. We got our stamps in our passports, walked out of the office and the &#8220;pen guy&#8221; was waiting for us. He offered a price of 45$ toÂ <em>our hotelÂ </em>(we were 3, as Nicky, an American friend we had met in Koh Chang, had joined us). After negotiating a bit, we agreed on 40$ (13$ each) and we were on our way to Siem Reap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Crossing the Cambodian border: CHECKED!</h2>
<p>So far so good! But we knew it wasn&#8217;t over yet. Turns out you can&#8217;t really trust these guys at all. He didn&#8217;t take us to our hotels, but to a random place in the city where a guy in his Tuk Tuk came to pick us up. He would only take us for free if we hired him for the next day to visit Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>We said no and started to negotiate prices again. Our friend Nicky was staying in a different hostel, meaning the guy wasn&#8217;t happy about doing 2 stops. He wanted us to pay 5$ each to take us to the hostels (15$ in total), but we said we would take another Tuk Tuk and he finally settled in 10$. We would later find out that was still very pricey, but at that moment we didn&#8217;t care. 15 minutes later,<strong> we made it to our hostel safe and sound</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summing up, if you&#8217;re thinking about crossing the Cambodian border by land, <strong>don&#8217;t stress and do it</strong>, it&#8217;s fine! We left Koh Chang at 7 AM and arrived at our hostel in Siem Reap at 5 PM<strong>. </strong>I can&#8217;t say it was a pleasant journey but it wasn&#8217;t that bad and<strong> it turned out to be a bit of fun.</strong> It&#8217;s sad neither the Thai nor Cambodian governments care about tourists being scammed as soon as they enter their countries. This shouldn&#8217;t stop you from enjoying what really is a beautiful country with beautiful people!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for accommodation, we stayed at <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/kh/velkommen-boutique-villa.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Velkommen Guesthouse</a>.</strong> It was cheap, nice (swimming pool!) and well located as it&#8217;s closer to Angkor Wat than most of the hostels. They provide free bikes so you can cycle to the city centre (10 minutes) or to Angkor Wat! 100% recommended it!</p>

On this post, we explain how to get to Bangkok from Koh Samui. Also, if you are interested in the other way around, Koh Samui to Bangkok, the same rules and options apply. These are the 4 options:</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8801912-10639348"><strong>Flight to Bangkok from Koh Samui</strong></a></h2>
<p>The most comfortable way but only for those travelling onÂ a deep budget. Bangkok Airways runs this route many times during the day at around 130$ one way. The flight is 1hour 15 minutes and Bangkok Airways is spot on, including their tasty snack. Book here in <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8801912-10639348">SkyScanner</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Bus</strong></a></h2>
<p>This option will take you to Bangkok in 12-13 hours depending on the starting port and the company. We have NOT done it but we&#8217;ve heard some opinions. It&#8217;s notÂ <em>too</em> bad but keeps in mind you will be on a boat for a long time and then a long run in a bus will be waiting for you. Not much fun, especially on choppy days.</p>
<p>The price is around 1200à¸¿-1400à¸¿ (38-44$). <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Van + Train</strong></a></h2>
<p>A bit more comfortable but very long, around 18 hours. A ferry will take you to the mainland and then by van, you will get to Suratthani train station. Then you need to take a train to Bangkok. The train goes from 18:37 to 06:30 so you can get some good sleep in the night.</p>
<p>The price goes from 2289à¸¿ for a train first class ticket (72$) or 1758à¸¿ for a second class ticket (55$). <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Van + Flight</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our favourite, since it is good value on money, comfort and time. You could do the whole trip in around 6 hours depending on how long you need to wait for your flight. You&#8217;ll be taken fromÂ <strong>Na ThonÂ </strong>port to mainland in a ferry run by <em>Seatran Ferry</em>. The ride is actually nice, safe boat and it has a bar where you can get some instant soups at a good price. After an hour and a half, you get to the mainland, where a van is waiting for you to take you to the airport. Once there you just need to take a flight to Bangkok.</p>
<p>There are very economics flights provided by Thai Smile (great) or Thai Lion (just ok). The price for the boat+van goes from 230à¸¿ for the very early boats to 400à¸¿, plus 30-40$ for the flight. In total, you will get spend around 40-50$, almost as cheap as the Ferry + Bus option but way more comfortable and fast.Â <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The last tip</strong>: make sure you find a proper way to get to the port. We used an app called NavigoApp (Uber/Grab style) because we were told it was way cheaper than normal taxis in Koh Samui. We paid 550à¸¿ from Lamai Beach to Na Thon. However, some fellow travellers did the same trip using a regular taxi for 350à¸¿. I think they just got lucky with the taxi driver, but overall our experience with NavigoApp was awful as the app barely work.</p>
<p>Happy travelling!</p>

				<p>Planning a trip to Vietnam is definitely exciting. However, Vietnam is quite a big country and is hard to gauge how long you should spend in each place to make the most of it. <strong>The good news for you is that we&#8217;re here to help you organise your 3 week Vietnam itinerary.</strong> With our guide, you&#8217;ll go from north to south, but you could start in the south if it works best for you, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. Worth mentioning, we take our time when visiting places, as we don&#8217;t like visiting places just to put a tick on it.</p><p>But before we start&#8230;</p><h2>HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED?</h2><p>The currency is the Vietnamese Dong. You&#8217;ll get about 23,000 Dongs for a Dollar.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #248f8f;">1 USD = 23,000 VND</span> </p><p>Vietnam is a very cheap country, but it can also become expensive if you aren&#8217;t careful. Budget accommodations range between 15$ to 30$ per night, while food ranges between 2$ and 7$. If you really take good care of your money, you can allocate a 30$ budget per day. A 50$ per day budget will make a great holiday though.</p>					</div>

				<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">VISA</h2><p>A very important thing to double check. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vietnam is more restrictive than other countries in South East Asia. </span>Many nationalities get a 15 days visa on arrival, but others will need to apply for it before landing in Vietnam.</p><p>If for example, you want to follow our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a visa. You can do it online, taking 3 days and costing you 30$. If you didn&#8217;t do your homework and you&#8217;re short on time, there are some companies who will make a visa for you in even 15 minutes, but prepare the wallet&#8230;</p>					</div>

You could easily see everything in 2 days but we think you will appreciate Hanoi more if you take it easy.</p><p>The capital of Vietnam is one of the most lively cities we&#8217;ve ever been to. People just pass their day sitting on the street and sipping (amazing!) coffee. You will see the worst traffic you&#8217;ve ever witnessed, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. Hanoi is a beautiful city full of lovely quarters, things to do and new food to experience.</p><p>For a detailed guide to Hanoi &#8211; check our <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/11/04/hanoi-worth-visiting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post </a></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07840-730x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi temple" width="296" height="415" /></p><p>&#8211; Roam around Hoan Kiem lake. Visit Ngoc Son, a small temple situated in the middle of the lake.<br />&#8211; Wander around the Old and French Quarters.<br />&#8211; Visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. It&#8217;s incredible how much respect North-Vietnamese&#8217;s have for their old leader.<br />&#8211; Visit Hoa Lo prison, colloquially known as &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;.<br />&#8211; See the train passing on the  famous <b>&#8220;Train street&#8221; </b><br />&#8211; We did a free food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/</a> and it was amazing. The guides are students and they will take you to places that you would not go on your own. Great way to get you started with Vietnamese&#8217;s food.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07660-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Delicious Pho!" width="640" height="360" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3><p>&#8211; Don Xuan Market. You can find pretty much anything here.<br />&#8211; Museum of Anthropology, especially interesting if you&#8217;re into finding out about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam.<br />&#8211; Water puppet theatre.<br />&#8211; Opera house.</p><p><strong>TIP: </strong>If you get to Hanoi via plane, don&#8217;t take a creepy taxi to go to the city centre. Download GRAB. It cost us 10$ to go to the city centre, 3 times cheaper than the price the taxi drivers offer.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07859-2-792x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi street" width="364" height="471" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3><p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/old-quarter-view-hanoi-hostel.en.html?aid=1593087&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Old Quarter View Hanoi Hostel</a></strong></p><p>Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, it is the perfect hostel for backpackers. Comfort and value at the same time, it has options for under 10$ a night, breakfast included.</p><p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en.html?aid=1886851&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><strong>Hanoi La Selva</strong></a></p><p>Great facilities and lovely staff at a very reasonable price. Gorgeous rooms and located in the Old Quarter, next to Hoan Kiem lake.</p><figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/828/82825620.jpg" alt="Hanoi La Selva" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hanoi La Selva</figcaption></figure><h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Sapa -2 nights-</h2><p>The landscapes of the very north of Vietnam are a must see and you shouldn&#8217;t miss them. The easiest place to visit is Sapa, this comes at a cost though. We&#8217;ve heard Sapa can be very touristic and a bit fake. However, if you&#8217;re clever and book the right trekking, your experience will have nothing to do with that.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can avoid paying one night of accommodation by taking <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">this</a></strong> very comfortable night bus.</p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa-1024x815.jpg" alt="Hill Tribes of Sapa" width="640" height="509" /></h3><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our Trekking</h3><p>We booked a trekking called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; with <a href="http://sapaochau.org/">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a> and it was one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had when travelling. More about this <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/16/how-we-met-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">here</a> and <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3><p><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O’Chau</a></strong></p><p>Sapa O&#8217;Chau is also a humble hotel. You can stay here the night before/after your trekking. The rooms are clean and quite cheap, so it has good value.</p><p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/eco-palms-house-sapa.en.html?aid=1886846&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><b>Eco Palms House Retreat</b></a></p><p>For those looking for a eco retreat. Bungalows in the middle of rice-fields with amazing views to the mountain. You can also appreciate the views while sipping wine in a bath tub.</p><figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/206/206506622.jpg" alt="Eco Palms Retreat" width="1280" height="622" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Eco Palms Retreat</figcaption></figure><h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ha Long Bay &#8211; 1 or 2 nights-</h2><p>Our 3 week Vietnam itinerary would not be complete without a visit to Ha Long Bay, one of the highlights of every visitor to Vietnam. A boat cruise will take you around the Bay for 1 or 2 nights, depending on how long you choose to stay. We&#8217;re budget travellers, so we chose 1 night. Most of the companies will include transportation from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay in the price.</p><p>We&#8217;ve written<a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/"> this post</a> about how to choose between Sapa or Ha Long Bay in case you&#8217;re short on time or budget.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Boats usually spend the night in Ha Long Bay, meaning you end up sharing the night with hundreds of boats. Some cruises take a slightly different route, sleeping in Bai Tu Long Bay. This will make your experience MUCH BETTER. Our sunset was unforgettable.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08352-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa in Ha Long Bay cruise" width="640" height="360" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our choice</h3><p>We took the package called &#8220;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/indochina-sails-halong-city.en.html?aid=1886866&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Off the beaten track</a>&#8221; offered by Indochina Junk. With this option, you&#8217;ll spend the night in Bai Tu Long Bay. More about our experience <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p><h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ninh Binh -2 nights-</h2><p>We got to Ninh Binh via train from Hanoi. We had a great time biking around Tam Coc, although we were a bit unlucky as we had heavy rain for one day, meaning we couldn&#8217;t make it to the national park. Still, we had an amazing time in this beautiful countryside area.</p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08760-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Lake" width="640" height="360" /></p><p>&#8211; Tam Coc lake tour. One hour stroll in a small boat. The landscape is very similar to Ha Long Bay but it is still worth it.<br />&#8211; Bich Dong Pagoda<br />&#8211; Bird Valley<br />&#8211; Mua cave. The cave is the least important thing, make sure you hike the mountain to get the perfect views!</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08935-2-819x1024.jpg" alt="Iga in Ninh Binh" width="365" height="457" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3><p>&#8211; Cuc Phong National Park.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Rent a bike (most hostels provide very cheap bikes) and cycle everywhere. The roads are very safe and the views deserve to be appreciated. You won&#8217;t get the same experience using Tuk Tuks or motorbikes.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08577-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa cycling in Ninh Binh" width="640" height="360" /></p><h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08480-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc's pagoda" width="640" height="360" /></h3><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3><p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-dream-ninh-binh.en.html?aid=1588839&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Dream Hostel</a></strong></p><p>Awesome value. The location is just perfect, very close to many restaurants and attractions. The woman who runs it is great and the family, in general, will do everything they can to make you happy. They also offer cheap bikes rental and will help you booking buses to your next destination.</p><p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-horizon-bungalow.en.html?aid=1595697&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</a></strong></p><p>Outstanding bungalows surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible.

Be aware the bus wasn&#8217;t particularly safe, nothing do with the one we took to go to Sapa.</p><p>Hue is the city of the Citadel. While the Citadel is impressive and very interesting from a historical point of view, if we had to cut down one day from our itinerary it would be Hue. Still, we had a nice day and enjoyed the city. During the night there is a nice market by the river and many nice options for dinner.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09004-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hue Temple" width="640" height="360" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3><p>&#8211; Hue Citadel and Forbidden City<br />&#8211; Walk stroll next to the river.

Delicious breakfast included! Just tremendous value.</p><p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-scarlett-boutique.en.html?aid=1595714&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</a></strong></p><p>Very affordable luxury rooms (about 50$ the night). One of the most visited and prestigious hotels in Hue, you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.</p><figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/806/80608521.jpg" alt="The Scarlett Boutique Hotel" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</figcaption></figure><h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Hoi An -6 nights-</h2><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09214-819x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An temple" width="435" height="545" /></p><p>Continuing our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, we&#8217;ll get to Hoi An. To get to this gem town, we strongly recommend the train if you come from Hue. It goes next to the Hai Van pass, a 21 km mountain pass with beautiful views to the sea.</p><p>Hoi An is no doubt our favourite city of Vietnam. Beach, rice fields and a beautiful old town make the city of the lanterns one of the most unique places we&#8217;ve ever visited. We have to admit we loved it so much we ended up staying for 10 days, 4 days more than we had planned.</p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3><p>&#8211; An Bang beach. Relaxing beach with very good and tasty restaurants. Also, you can do parasailing for 30$ 2 persons. We did it and was AMAZING.<br />&#8211; The old town at night. Have a stroll at the old town in the night, when all the lanterns are on. Simply beautiful.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09473-e1540057985468.jpg" alt="Hoi An at night" width="478" height="382" /></p><p>&#8211; No better city to buy souvenirs. We bought a few too many lanterns (but we don&#8217;t regret it!).<br />&#8211; Ride a motorbike around Hoi An. We&#8217;ll never forget the joy of riding the motorbike from the city centre to the beach, passing next to the rice fields.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09455-1024x819.jpg" alt="Hoi An lights" width="560" height="448" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3><p>&#8211; Ancient town tour. Old houses, museums, Japanese covered bridge, etc.<br />&#8211; Marble Mountains, halfway between Da Nang and Hoi An.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Motorbike is a must in Hoi An. The roads are good and traffic is more &#8220;western&#8221; than in other places of the country. Another plus: you won&#8217;t have to deal with tuk-tuk or taxi drivers.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09167-672x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An river" width="431" height="656" /></p><h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3><p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/melody-boutique-villa-hoi-an.en.html?aid=1602524&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Melody Boutique Villa Hoi An</a></strong></p><p>Modern construction, clean, fresh and very comfortable.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few days before our one month visa in Vietnam expired, we decided to finish our north-to-south trip doing something special: we wanted to spend our last days <strong>Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh.</strong> This would give us the chance to spend some quality time with locals, something that we hadn&#8217;t managed so far for one reason or another.</p>
<p>This is how we found Thao, a girl who quitted her job to open <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SaigonEnglishAdventures/about/">Saigon English Adventures</a></strong>, an English school in Hoh Chi Minh, or better known as Saigon. She offers free accommodation at her place in exchange for volunteering in a few English classes with her students. We aren&#8217;t native speakers but we thought it should be good fun, so we applied. Thao promptly came back approving the stay. We were going to spend a few days interacting with Vietnamese people, exciting times!</p>
<p>She told us she would be away most of our stay as she was on holidays, so her roommate Jane would really be our host. We landed in Saigon from Da Nang at midnight, hopped into a Grab heading to the provided address. Jane picked us up with a huge smile and took us home. We would be sleeping in the living room, that turned out to be also the English school classroom!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Visiting Saigon</h2>
<p>Next day we woke up early and went out to do some sightseeing. We walked to the city center (also called District 1) to discover a bit of Saigon, a unique city. Crazy traffic with motorbikes everywhere, chickens in the street, motorbike taxi drivers taking naps on their bikes, etc. A huge pink Catholic church caught our attention, as we had never seen one like it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-569 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg" alt="Pink church in Saigon" width="527" height="937" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-169x300.jpg 169w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>After walking a while we got to the War Memorial Museum. There we had another lesson of how sad and unnecessary wars are. For lunch, we got some cheap Pho, you can&#8217;t beat the price! (30 Vietnamese dongs = 1.5$).</p>
<p>From lunch to evening we wandered around the city center, where we found the <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/24/the-strangest-protest-ever/">strangest protest we have ever witnessed</a>.</p>
<p>Next day we woke up early to visit the Cu Chi tunnels, one of the most popular attractions in Vietnam. If you want to read about this or you want to know how to visit the Cu Chi tunnels on our own, <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/15/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/">visit this post.</a> Once back from the tunnels, the most exciting part of the trip was about to start: English classes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>English classes</h2>
<p>Jane told us the English teacher couldn&#8217;t make it to the class, meaning we had to drive the class with her help. Iga got a bit stressed about it but I was fine with it, I knew it was going to be so much fun!</p>
<p>One by one, the students started arriving. They were more or less on our age, a bit younger maybe. And you can&#8217;t imagine how cute they were! Their English was limited but they could communicate, especially because they were not shy at all, which makes everything much easier. The class ended up being 2 hours of &#8220;Ask me anything&#8221; and it was just so much fun. We also got to know a bit about each of them and we can tell they are beautiful people.</p>
<p>After the class, they invited us for dinner at a very Vietnamese restaurant. They ordered so much traditional food, which we obviously appreciated as sometimes can be daunting to try new food in exotic countries. We drank, laughed, ate, exchanged social media profiles, life experiences&#8230;and that was it! At the end of the night we were so happy with the experience, and also a bit sad because we could not stay any longer with them.</p>
<p>Next day we woke up and met Thao, the Couchsurfing host and the director of the school. We got to chat a bit with her, enough to be inspired by the happiness she emits. After having breakfast, we assisted her with a new English class. This group&#8217;s level was very basic, plus you could tell they weren&#8217;t very used to be with foreign people, so they were a bit shy. Still, it was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Spending the weekend Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh was an amazing experience. It was exactly what we look for when traveling: visiting new places and meeting inspiring people, like Thao, Jane or their students. What about you? What do you look for when traveling?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During our visit to Ho Chi Minh (also called Saigon), we happened to witness the strangest protest ever!</p>
<p>Hundreds of people <strong>riding motorbikes </strong>gathered in the city center (District 1) to protest in front of a government building. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever seen so many flags and motorbikes in such a small space! We found interesting the police&#8217;s behavior; they soon arrived to shut down the protest, but it was clear they were in favor of it. They took their time before forcing riders to move away from the building. After this, they kept riding the city center for quite a while.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">By the looks of it, we could tell was something against immigrants but we didn&#8217;t feel threatened at any moment, meaning it wasn&#8217;t related to tourists. After a while, a very sophisticated Vietnamese man with a very correct English explained to us what was this about. Turns out there is a law in Vietnam that allows foreigners to rent properties for 99 years. Vietnamese feel Chinese are taking advantage of this law and they are occupying big chunks of towns, making them more Chinese than Vietnamese. From what we saw there, Vietnamese are not a fan of their Chinese neighbors, as you could read big banners saying &#8220;Chinese out of Vietnam NOW&#8221; or &#8220;Vietnam for Vietnamese&#8221;. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">There is a law in Vietnam that allows foreigners to rent properties for 99 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This topic is creating a lot of tension for the party in charge of the government, the Vietnamese Communist Party (Vietnam is one of the 5 countries to be communist nowadays, along with Laos, China, North Korea and Cuba). They need to expand its economic relationships with China, it&#8217;s neighbor to the north, but at the same time their population feels they&#8217;re selling their country for money.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this interesting topic, this <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152150/dont-give-our-land-away-clash-interests-vietnams-anti">article</a> talks about it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Protest in Saigon" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ripKCX9SEWk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The video shows very well the essence of Vietnam: motorbikes &amp; patriotism.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_tunnels">Cu Chi tunnels</a></strong> on your own is something we recommend everyone to do when <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/09/couch-surfing-in-ho-chi-minh/">visiting Ho Chi Minh</a>. The Cu Chi tunnels are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels that cover up to 250 km. Using these tunnels you could even get to Cambodia! They played a key role in the war to beat the Americans, who tried to destroy them many times but couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To get there tourists usually hire a group tour but <strong>there is a way to get to the Cu Chi tunnels on your own.</strong> Most importantly, tours take tourists to a less authentic side of the tunnels, whereas going by yourself you get to the side where Vietnamese tourists go. Don&#8217;t worry, you will still get an English speaking guide. Ours was very funny!</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>How to get to the Cu Chi tunnels on your own</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to Pham Ngu Lao bus station.</li>
<li>Take bus number 13 that will take you to Ben Xe Cu Chi (last stop).</li>
<li>Get the bus 79 to Cu Chi tunnels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bus tickets are <strong>7000 Vietnamese dongs</strong> each (0.3$), whereas tickets for the Cu Chi tunnels are <strong>90000 dongs</strong> (4$). English speaking guide included in the price.</p>
<p><strong>Funny fact</strong>: the buses don&#8217;t stop until the end of the journey, so it&#8217;s kind of a challenge to hop on/off the bus. I really felt bad for an old man trying to hop off, Vietnam is not a country for old men.</p>
<h2>The visit</h2>
<p>The visit shows how tough and driven the Vietnamese people were during the war. The tunnels are claustrophobic and crazy small. It&#8217;s incredible the Vietnamese managed to live for so long in a place like this. Everything was very well designed and thought of. They had hospitals, kitchens and leaders meeting rooms inside them. If one tunnel was bombed and compromised, the rest of the tunnels would be fine. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Iga proved to be braver than me and entered in every single tunnel, while I only did it in a few. I&#8217;m going to make up an excuse and say I&#8217;m too tall (I&#8217;m not). There was one tunnel in which you could even hear a bat flying around haha. Nope, I&#8217;m not going in there sir!</p>
<p>At the end of the visit, you can shoot some guns if you&#8217;re into that (we aren&#8217;t). There is also a beautiful temple in honor of the war victims and Ho Chi Minh. We were lucky to see a school trip there, participating in a ceremony in Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s honor, singing and waving Vietnamese flag. Very patriotic, just like Vietnamese are!</p>

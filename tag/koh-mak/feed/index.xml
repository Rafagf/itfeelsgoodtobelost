										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note</strong>: This post was last updated on <strong>June 2023</strong> to include the most current information and recommendations.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning a trip to Thailand, Koh Chang should be on your list. In this guide, we&#8217;ll explore the best things to do in Koh Chang, a hidden gem in Trat&#8217;s province, southeast of Thailand. Despite fierce competition, there are compelling reasons to believe that Koh Chang is one of the best islands in Thailand.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting to Koh Chang</strong></h2>
<p>Getting to Koh Chang might be a bit tricky as there&#8217;s no airport on the island. You can either fly to Trat&#8217;s airport from Bangkok and then take a taxi to Ao Thammachat&#8217;s port, where you can reach Koh Chang by sea in 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can take a bus from Ekkamai&#8217;s bus station in Bangkok, which takes around six hours (but is very comfortable!), and then catch a boat.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re on the island, you can get around by taxi or by renting a motorbike. <strong>Exploring Koh Chang on a motorbike is one of our favorite memories from our trips around the world</strong>. It&#8217;s the best and cheapest option if you know how to drive.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s dive into the best things to do in Koh Chang.</p>
<h2><strong>What to do</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Klong Koi Beach</strong></h4>
<p>This beach is a paradise. The sand is amazing, and the water is surprisingly warm. On your way, visit Bang Bao Pier, where you can have a smoothie and do some shopping in the shops on the pier.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-184 size-large" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-845x1024.jpg" alt="koh chang " width="640" height="776" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-845x1024.jpg 845w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-248x300.jpg 248w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-768x931.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-1267x1536.jpg 1267w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-xx1-e1582292336841-1690x2048.jpg 1690w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4><strong>Lonely Beach</strong></h4>
<p>While the beach in Lonely Beach is nothing special, the area is great for enjoying food or having some drinks. The atmosphere is very chilled during the day, although it can get a bit lively at night with some parties going on. Lonely Beach is also a great spot to enjoy sunrises. We enjoyed an awesome one at <a href="https://www.agoda.com/es-es/warapura-resort/hotel/koh-chang-th.html?finalPriceView=2&amp;isShowMobileAppPrice=false&amp;cid=1763310&amp;numberOfBedrooms=&amp;familyMode=false&amp;adults=2&amp;children=0&amp;rooms=1&amp;maxRooms=0&amp;checkIn=2023-06-12&amp;isCalendarCallout=false&amp;childAges=&amp;numberOfGuest=0&amp;missingChildAges=false&amp;travellerType=-1&amp;showReviewSubmissionEntry=false&amp;currencyCode=EUR&amp;isFreeOccSearch=false&amp;tag=3ca4e5ca-12bf-3f82-a5b3-51dd334b432a&amp;isCityHaveAsq=false&amp;los=1&amp;searchrequestid=d3196397-4a4e-4057-a418-7c2e442572b1">Warapura Resort</a>, which has happy hours in the early evening, making it the perfect spot to see the sunset.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-sunset-e1582292527691.jpg" alt="koh chang sunset" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<h4>Best Beaches in Koh Chang: White Sand, Khlong Prao, and Kai Bae</h4>
<p>These three beaches are some of the best places to visit in Koh Chang. White Sand Beach is the most popular and busiest beach on the island. It&#8217;s a great place to relax, swim, and enjoy the sun. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, making it a lively place to spend the day.</p>
<p>Khlong Prao Beach is a bit quieter but equally beautiful. It&#8217;s a long, sandy beach that&#8217;s perfect for long walks and sunbathing. The beach is lined with coconut trees, adding to its tropical charm. There are also several resorts and restaurants nearby.</p>
<p>Kai Bae Beach is a hidden gem. It&#8217;s less crowded than the other two beaches, making it a great place to relax and enjoy the tranquility. The beach is surrounded by lush greenery, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<h4>Exploring Khlong Phlu Waterfall: A Must-Do in Koh Chang</h4>
<p>If you get tired of beaches, you can go to Khlong Phlu, where you can have a nice short trek and enjoy sunbathing by a waterfall. You can dive in if you don&#8217;t mind the company of the small-medium fish!</p>
<p>Remember to wear sturdy shoes for the hike and bring some insect repellent to protect yourself from mosquitoes. There&#8217;s a small entrance fee to the national park, but it&#8217;s well worth it for the chance to see this beautiful waterfall.</p>
<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<h4><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.es.html">Little Eden Bungalows</a></strong></h4>
<p>For budget travelers, Little Eden Bungalows is a great option. Located in Lonely Beach, there are about 10 small bungalows. They also rent motorbikes for a good price (300 bahts).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-187 size-large" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1024x900.jpg" alt="little eden" width="640" height="563" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1024x900.jpg 1024w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-300x264.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-768x675.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1536x1349.jpg 1536w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-2048x1799.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Comfort option</strong>:Â <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/santhiya.es.html">Santhiya Tree Koh Chang Resort</a></h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a bit more comfort, Santhiya Tree Koh Chang Resort is an excellent choice. With its excellent location, amazing pool, live music, delicious breakfast, and great sunsets, it&#8217;s an outstanding resort.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/santhiya.en.html?aid=1593090&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"><img decoding="async" class="size-full aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/162/162915342.jpg" width="1280" height="853" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Embrace the Adventure</strong></h2>
<p>Remember, Koh Chang is one of those places where you donât really need to worry about what to do. Just ride a motorbike and GET LOST. You can also visit Koh Mak and Koh Kut, the other islands in the archipelago. We&#8217;ve heard great things about them, but they are a bit far, so if you go, make sure you get some accommodation to spend the night and make the most of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cycling around Angkor Wat was great until we realized what was ahead of us&#8230;</p>
<p>After a long trip from Thailand, we had made it to Siem Reap (Cambodia) ready to enjoy of Angkor Wat or more correctly Angkor Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<strong> Angkor is a 1000 years old city, a huge temple complex and the largest religious monument in the world, as large as the size of London!</strong> Not so long ago, it was completely covered by the surrounding jungle and in fact, many temples are still hidden, waiting for the Cambodian government to gather some money to uncover them.</p>
<p>Angkor Wat was built in Angkor, the capital of the Khmer empire, one of the most powerful empires of the world between the 9th and 15th centuries. It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple, but it gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century. An interesting fact is that still today, it is unknown why and how the empire weakened, being 1431 the date for its collapse when the Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya sacked the whole city.</p>
<p>The expectations were high and I was a bit afraid Angkor Park would disappoint us. Turns out there is nothing to worry about. Angkor Wat is a MUST for every true traveler. And if you&#8217;re a temple geek, you will simply love it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-563 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rafa in Angkor Wat" width="392" height="588" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-200x300.jpg 200w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>
<h2><strong>How to get there?</strong></h2>
<p>Angkor Park is in Siem Reap, Cambodia. You can fly to Siem Reap, or <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/05/07/how-to-survive-crossing-the-thai-cambodian-border/">cross the Thai-Cambodian border if you&#8217;re coming from Thailand like we did</a>. You could also do the same thing if you come from Vietnam.</p>
<h2><strong>How much is it?</strong></h2>
<p>Siem Reap is very cheap, costing a meal around 3$. Accommodation is also cheap, we stayed on <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/kh/velkommen-boutique-villa.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Velkommen Guesthouse</a> </strong>and it was around 10$ each night. The hotel was top notch, great staff, very clean, provided bikes and it had a (small) swimming pool.</p>
<p>Angkor Park, however, is quite pricey. You have 3 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 day: 37$</strong>. Too short, you will barely have time to enjoy Angkor Wat and a few temples around, but that&#8217;s it.</li>
<li><strong>3 days: 62$</strong>. This is what we did. The third wasn&#8217;t necessary for us, but there is nothing you can do about it.</li>
<li><strong>7 days: 72$</strong>. Only if you&#8217;re REALLY a temples fan.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to move around</strong></h2>
<p>Most of the people hire a Tuk Tuk from the street or the hotel to visit the park. Other moves around by motorbikes, despite the rumors of this being illegal. And others, like us,<strong> decide cycling around Angkor Wat</strong> is the way to go. If you hire a Tuk Tuk from the street, make sure your driver speaks a bit of English as this will make a big difference in your visit. Also, make sure you negotiate the price as otherwise, they will rip you off. Hiring someone from the hotel should be a very good idea despite the commission too.</p>

<h2><strong>Our experience</strong></h2>
<h3><em>First day: big circuit</em></h3>
<p>We wanted to be active and decided to use the bikes the hotel provided to us. Angkor is a really HOT place so you have to start the day very early and retire early. A very popular thing nowadays is to get to the park at <strong>5:30AM to see Angkor Wat at sunrise</strong>. We read this has become kind of a tourist trap as it gets really crowded and you barely see anything, so we decided to draw our own plan.</p>
<p>The alarm rang at 4:30AM. Equipped with our lanterns, we cycled to Angkor Park. 30 minutes later, we passed by Angkor Wat. Staying there was not appealing at all, it was so busy! That&#8217;s why we stuck to the plan and cycle a bit more. 10 minutes later we made it to Bayon, one of the biggest temples in the park. We were just in time for the sunrise and oh boy, it was well worth it. <strong>We had the temple just for ourselves, only to be shared with a dog and a monk that was having his early walk.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-551 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1.jpg" alt="Angkor Wat sunrise" width="2200" height="1467" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1.jpg 2200w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2200px) 100vw, 2200px" /></p>
<p>From here, you can either do the small circuit or the big one. <strong>We decided to go for the big one and I have to be honest: we completely underestimated how exhausting cycling around Angkor Park can be.</strong> Preah Khan, Neak Pean, Ta Som are a few names of temples we visited.</p>
<p>Around 1 PM we were a bit templed out and decided to call it for the day. If you ask me, the way back home was fun and rewarding (we saw a family of monkeys on the road!) but if you ask Iga she will probably say different. She barely spoke to me for a few hours haha. To be fair, cycling 35 km under the sun wasn&#8217;t on my plans either.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-548 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3.jpg" alt="Temples" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3.jpg 3000w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<p>After this, we headed to the city center to have lunch. Parallel to the Old Market, there is a street with plenty of options. We had lunch in one where the beer was ridiculously cheap, like 0.5$ or even less. That felt GOOD after so much cycling!</p>
<p>Time to come back to the hotel and chill by the pool! For dinner, we couldn&#8217;t bother to go to the city center again and ended up eating in a local restaurant nearby. We got Fish Amok and Khmer Red Curry, both typical Cambodian dishes. We didn&#8217;t love them but they were alright. Take your anti-mosquitoes with you for the night or you will regret it!</p>
<h3><em>Second day: small circuit</em></h3>
<p>Cycling around Angkor Wat for a second day would have cost me my relationship. So, we hired a TukTuk from our hotel. Our driver, called Dada, was such a nice guy and helped us to plan the day. The price was around 28$ + tip, which obviously is up to you. We are budget travelers but for what he offered and what we learned from him we were more than happy with the price.</p>
<p>We decided not to do the sunrise thing in Angkor Wat as we were very tired and wanted to get some sleep time. Also, from what we had seen the previous day it didn&#8217;t look worth it. In the end, we got to Angkor Wat at 6.30 AM and spent 2 hours walking around. The pictures say it all, it is indeed amazing!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-561 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2.jpg" alt="A monk in Angkor Wat" width="2734" height="1864" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2.jpg 2734w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-300x205.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-768x524.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-1024x698.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2734px) 100vw, 2734px" /></p>
<p>After Angkor Wat, Dada took us to Banteay Samre, a temple quite far from the small/big circuits, deep in the countryside. It took 45 minutes to get there. The temple was very cool, but the ride in the Tuk Tuk was even better. We got to really see how Cambodians family live in the countryside (they live under 1$ per day) and the landscapes are BEAUTIFUL. We stopped along the way to learn how the palm oil is done and taste some sweets made out of it, very very tasty! Pure sugar straight to your blood.</p>
<p>After this, Dada took us back to our hotel to have lunch and a nap. He picked us up around 3 PM to see the rest of the small circuit. The highlight of the day was Ta Prohm, also called the &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; temple, as the movie was filmed here. In this temple, you really feel like you&#8217;re Angelina Jolie or Indiana Jones. It is truly amazing and I think we enjoyed it even more than Angkor Wat.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-541 size-full aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146.jpg" alt="Tomb Raider" width="1795" height="1346" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146.jpg 1795w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-768x576.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1795px) 100vw, 1795px" /></p>
<p>To finish the day, Dada took us to enjoy the sunset to Phnom Bakheng, a viewpoint where it said you get amazing views. Unfortunately, they only allow 300 people up there so we couldn&#8217;t enjoy it. One thing I wish they changed it&#8217;s the fact they tell you this once you&#8217;ve reached the very top of the hill. So much for nothing! Anyway, we came back to Dada and asked him to take us to <strong>see the sunset at Angkor Wat</strong>. The sun doesn&#8217;t set there, but we had the chance to take beautiful pictures as it was less crowded than usual.</p>
<p>Just worth mentioning, we found many kids begging and selling stuff around Angkor Wat (and other temples), supervised by their parents in the distance. PLEASE don&#8217;t buy anything from them, these kids should be in school but if their parents see they can make a living out of them they will do it.</p>
<p>After this, Dada took us back to Siem Reap, where we had dinner in the city centre. We tried the best ice cream we have ever had: fried ice cream! It is hard to describe how it tastes but believe me, you won&#8217;t regret having it. There are many different flavours, we tried Oreo and Kinder Bueno, and both were simply amazing.</p>
<p>We had another half day in Siem Reap, but we were exhausted and a bit templed out. That&#8217;s why we decided to spend it chilling by the pool and getting ready to take the bus to Phnom Peng, the capital of Cambodia.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you already visited Angkor Wat? If not&#8230;does cycling around Angkor Wat something for you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have ever heard about a town called <strong>Poipet</strong>, the chances are you didn&#8217;t hear anything good about it. There are horror stories online about crossing the Cambodian border from Thailand (and the other way around) by this town. I&#8217;m not going to list them as the Internet is flooded with posts about it, but I&#8217;ll share our experience.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: It wasn&#8217;t as bad as they say it is!</strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Before crossing the Cambodian border</h2>
<p>We were in <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/05/26/koh-chang-a-hidden-paradise-of-thailand/"><strong>Koh Chang</strong></a>, an island on the Gulf of Thailand. We decided to travel to Cambodia, due to its proximity and to visit <strong>Angkor Wat</strong>, one of the most amazing monuments in the world.</p>
<p>While In Ko Chang, we stayed at <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><strong>Little Eden Bungalows</strong></a>, a beautiful backpackers bungalow resort, where we were offered transportation to Siem Reap (the city where Angkor Wat is) through an external Thai company. The receptionist recommended not do the whole trip with them and get a taxi as soon as we reached Cambodia. This way we would avoid scams like: &#8220;Sorry the bus is broken, you all need to get these expensive taxis waiting conveniently for you in this corner&#8221;.</p>
<p>We had also read online to not even complete the whole trip in Thai side with them. They would do a stop before crossing the Cambodian border in a restaurant a few kilometres away, collecting everyone&#8217;s passports and forcing you to get the Cambodian visa through an unofficial office where you end up paying up to two times more!</p>
<p>The list of scams goes on and on, but we still decided to go for it. It was much cheaper and comfortable than coming all the way back to Bangkok and fly to Siem Reap.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: Don&#8217;t overread online about crossing the Cambodian border. </strong>YES, you need to do to make sure you read a bit to have everything under control. Once you&#8217;ve done that, stop reading. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be like me; worried to death the night before and asking yourself why on earth you would do something like that. IT WILL BE OK <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The CROSSING day</h2>
<p>In the morning, a mini-van picked us up at 7 AM. The guy didn&#8217;t seem very friendly, but who cares, right? After picking up some tourists we made it to the pier, where we waited 30 minutes for the ferry. 45 minutes later we had made it to the mainland.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-191 size-full" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/koh-chang101.jpg" alt="crossing the cambodian border: ready!" width="6000" height="4000" /></p>
<p>Back in the mini-van, we had a 3 hours drive ahead of us to <strong>Aranyaprathet</strong>, the Thai town where the border is. Turned up the stories were right and the guys took us to a restaurant where we &#8220;<em>would have lunch before going to the visa office</em>&#8220;. We said <em>&#8220;nope, thank you, we&#8217;ll walk&#8221;,</em> got our luggage and started walking. We had read they could get pushy when doing this but they were totally ok with it.</p>
<p>At this point, it was recommended to get a Tuk Tuk to the border, as the town is supposed to be dangerous. We didn&#8217;t see any (plus they would try to take us to the &#8220;unofficial office&#8221; to scam us), so we just walked. The town wasn&#8217;t <em>nice</em> but it didn&#8217;t feel dangerous either. Thai people taking care of their business and not a single person said anything to us. After 15 minutes we made it to the border. Happy times!</p>
<p>We were expecting long queues but it was clear we were way ahead than most of the tourists, which were probably stuck &#8220;having lunch&#8221;. In less than 10-15 minutes we had our leaving stamp in the passport and we were in Poipet, Cambodia.</p>
<p>Once there, some guys tried to help us out with our transport to Siem Reap as they &#8220;knew someone who could take us very cheap&#8221;. After ignoring them, we walked to the Visa Cambodian office where we would get our visa. Funny enough, we found again an empty office, full of Cambodian officers (around 10) and maybe 3-4 tourists. We filled up the requested documents, handed it to the officers along with a photo and&#8230;it was scam time again!</p>
<p><strong>The visa price is officially 30$</strong>, and even in the office, there is a big sign that says the same thing, 30$. We had read they would ask for more money and turned out to be right. The officer pointed to a very lame paper where we could read: <em>&#8220;30$ + 100 Baths&#8221;</em> (Bath is the Thai currency, 100 baths are about 3$). We said <em>&#8220;nope, it&#8217;s only 30$, is written there&#8221;</em>, but the guy didn&#8217;t even blink and repeated &#8220;<em>100 Baths</em>&#8220;. We tried to make him understand but he left us no choice, so we gave him the 100 baths.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to avoid the scam wasn&#8217;t really about the money but about playing by the book. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have enough patience. If you hand out the 30$, sit and wait, after some time they will give you the visa. Who knows how long you will wait though.</p></blockquote>
<p>We walked a bit more and pass around a few casinos where Thai people gamble as it&#8217;s illegal in Thailand. Next step was to get the Cambodia entering stamp in our passport, which went quite smoothly. A random guy offered me a pen and of course, it turned out he knew a guy that would take us very cheap to Siem Reap. We got our stamps in our passports, walked out of the office and the &#8220;pen guy&#8221; was waiting for us. He offered a price of 45$ to <em>our hotel </em>(we were 3, as Nicky, an American friend we had met in Koh Chang, had joined us). After negotiating a bit, we agreed on 40$ (13$ each) and we were on our way to Siem Reap.</p>

<h2>Crossing the Cambodian border: CHECKED!</h2>
<p>So far so good! But we knew it wasn&#8217;t over yet. Turns out you can&#8217;t really trust these guys at all. He didn&#8217;t take us to our hotels, but to a random place in the city where a guy in his Tuk Tuk came to pick us up. He would only take us for free if we hired him for the next day to visit Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>We said no and started to negotiate prices again. Our friend Nicky was staying in a different hostel, meaning the guy wasn&#8217;t happy about doing 2 stops. He wanted us to pay 5$ each to take us to the hostels (15$ in total), but we said we would take another Tuk Tuk and he finally settled in 10$. We would later find out that was still very pricey, but at that moment we didn&#8217;t care. 15 minutes later,<strong> we made it to our hostel safe and sound</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summing up, if you&#8217;re thinking about crossing the Cambodian border by land, <strong>don&#8217;t stress and do it</strong>, it&#8217;s fine! We left Koh Chang at 7 AM and arrived at our hostel in Siem Reap at 5 PM<strong>. </strong>I can&#8217;t say it was a pleasant journey but it wasn&#8217;t that bad and<strong> it turned out to be a bit of fun.</strong> It&#8217;s sad neither the Thai nor Cambodian governments care about tourists being scammed as soon as they enter their countries. This shouldn&#8217;t stop you from enjoying what really is a beautiful country with beautiful people!</p>

<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for accommodation, we stayed at <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/kh/velkommen-boutique-villa.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Velkommen Guesthouse</a>.</strong> It was cheap, nice (swimming pool!) and well located as it&#8217;s closer to Angkor Wat than most of the hostels. They provide free bikes so you can cycle to the city centre (10 minutes) or to Angkor Wat! 100% recommended it!</p>

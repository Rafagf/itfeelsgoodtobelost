										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is this false belief, that you must be rich in order to travel. When explaining to some acquaintances how long we were gonna travel for, some of them would react like &#8220;<em>Wow, you guys are loaded!</em>&#8220;. We are far from being loaded! The funny thing is, those who say that probably go on holidays for 2 weeks, spending the same money than us in 2 months! That&#8217;s why we want to share our 3 rules to travel cheap!</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve discovered that spending more money usually doesn&#8217;t make your trip any better, in fact, if anything, it makes it less authentic.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I only have 2 weeks of holidays per year. I an definitively staying in that 5 stars hotel, look at that bath tube!&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>1. Choose your destination wisely</strong></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, your holidays are going to depend a lot on the country you are at. It&#8217;s not the same to visit Myanmar than visiting Switzerland. Whenever you go somewhere expensive, be aware that there is a tradeoff&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Moving by taxi if you feel tired vs public transport, meaning you end up exhausted every day</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Eating wherever you feel into vs. eating in McDonald&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t afford anything else (e.g. Hong Kong is famous for its super cheap Michelin Star restaurants!)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Boat to that magic cave + kayaking + cooking lesson + motorbike tour vs free walking tour around the city</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">You get the idea&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122" style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-122" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_20180421_094233.jpg" alt="Rules to travel cheap: Don't do Japanese trains" width="278" height="370" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_094233.jpg 3000w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_094233-225x300.jpg 225w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_094233-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-122" class="wp-caption-text">Two-week railway pass in Japan can ruin anyone&#8217;s budget&#8230; BTW, bullet trains are amazing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, one of the most important rules to travel cheap is to <strong>choose countries that are considered cheap for your budget</strong>. This does not mean you can&#8217;t go to, let&#8217;s say Japan, for 3 weeks and still make it affordable like we did.&nbsp; However, for the same money, you could spend 6 weeks in Thailand without counting every penny!</p>
<h2><strong>2. Accommodation</strong></h2>
<p>The next of our rules to travel cheap is to&nbsp;<strong>stay away from hotels</strong>. Hotels are usually expensive and they are not worth the money. Plus, who wants to stay in a room where you can&#8217;t really tell which country you are at? We like to have a local experience, which hotels don&#8217;t really give you. Our favourites alternatives:</p>
<h3><strong>Airbnb</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-121 size-large" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_181959812_hdr-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rules to travel cheap: AirBnb" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_181959812_hdr-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_181959812_hdr-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_181959812_hdr-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<figure id="attachment_120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-120 size-large" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_182206681-1024x576.jpg" alt="Our beautiful flat in Porto" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_182206681-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_182206681-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20170414_182206681-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-120" class="wp-caption-text">Our beautiful flat in Porto</figcaption></figure>
<p>We find Airbnb great, as you get to stay in truly&nbsp;local places and, in seconds, you feel like you belong there. Say hi to new neighbours, get a morning coffee in the local shop, warm baguettes from the bakery around the corner, and fresh fruits from the food market nearby. We love to cook from time to time, it is a DIY way to experiment with the local cuisine and try out some new recipes.</p>
<p>Hosts usually try to help you as much as possible to get a positive review, so it&#8217;s a win-win. Fair to be said, Airbnb is not super cheap and the hassle of checking in/out it&#8217;s usually not worth it for short stays (1-2 nights). We go for Airbnb when we want to stay for the medium-long term (4-5 days at least).</p>
<figure id="attachment_127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127" style="width: 6000px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-127 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07028.jpg" alt="Rules to travel cheap: Our flat in Japan" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07028.jpg 6000w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07028-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07028-768x512.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07028-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-127" class="wp-caption-text">Whenever we stay in Airbnb I can&#8217;t wait to get back to my morning routine (oh yes, routine sounds good when you travel non stop for a few months&#8230;)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>TIP</strong>: Many hosts offer you discounts for staying a week or a month. If you are thinking about staying 5-6 days, check how much would it be 7 days, as it may even be cheaper! Same thing with monthly stays.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1530604">Booking.com</a></strong></h3>
<p>We use any of these services for short stays. If you are going 2 days-1 night somewhere, you aren&#8217;t going to spend much time in your room. Thus, just get something cheap, well-located, clean and move on. You really don&#8217;t need that Smart TV, you have it at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TIP:</strong> Also, if possible, <strong>book&nbsp;your accommodation only a few days before arriving at your destination.</strong> Why? Hosts lose money when they have their place empty so they will be happy offering discounts. You may get up to 30-40% discount on the price! This also applies to Airbnb.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/"><strong>CouchSurfing</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the beginning of our trip, we were a bit worried about staying for free in someone&#8217;s home, but we have to admit we were wrong. If you find the right host, it&#8217;s an unbelieve experience. Keep in mind these people invite strangers to their home for free, so they do it because they enjoy it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-223" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/img_20180421_170542new.jpg?w=1000" alt="Rules to travel cheap: COACHSURFING!" width="387" height="255" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_170542new.jpg 2592w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_170542new-300x198.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_170542new-768x506.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180421_170542new-1024x675.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TIP:</strong> Offer something in exchange to truly enjoy your stay &#8211; you can cook some local cuisine from your country or speak some English to their kids, it will make the best travel story.</p>
<blockquote><p>We couchsurfed in a Japanese house in Hiroshima&#8217;s countryside with a local family and ended up singing Karaoke while drinking Sake. What hotel is going to give you that? And FOR FREE!</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably our favourite.</p>
<p><strong>With this platform, you go to someone&#8217;s home to take care of their pets while they are away &#8211; for free.</strong> You live in their home, meaning they are fully equipped and ready to have a very comfortable stay. Sometimes the houses are dream houses, you would not believe it.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to love animals, otherwise, this is not for you. <strong>You&#8217;ll be taking care of cats, dogs or pretty much anything they have at home.</strong> For us, this is far from being a problem, as we love animals and taking care of those 2 lovely brothers cats it&#8217;s the perfect excuse to travel to that paradise island.</p>
<figure id="attachment_125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125" style="width: 6000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-125 size-full" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/dsc03553.jpg" alt="Rules to travel cheap: pet sitting!" width="6000" height="4000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-125" class="wp-caption-text">Be ready, these cuties will follow you everywhere</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote><p>Staying FOR FREE in Koh Samui (Thailand), chilling by the pool and playing with 2 lovely cats? Yeah, I&#8217;m in</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind you&#8217;re not on holidays, meaning you should spend quality time with the animals and make sure they don&#8217;t miss their owners too much.</p>
<h2>3. Transport</h2>
<p>The last of our rules to travel cheap is, of course, related to transport. Some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy <strong>flights</strong> that are out of your budget. If possible, change your itinerary so you can fly cheaper. Never buy a flight without tracking for a few days how the price oscillates. Setting a <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8801912-10641620"><strong>Skyscanner</strong></a> alarm for a flight or Kayak &#8220;buy&#8221; advice are usually very useful.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, take <strong>buses</strong> as they are way cheaper than planes.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Using a regular <strong>taxi</strong> in, let&#8217;s say Bangkok, it&#8217;s pretty challenging, and you&#8217;re very likely to get ripped off. Use <strong><a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/wted3">Uber</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://r.grab.com/grabrafapiki">Grab</a></strong>. These apps make it really easy and they remove the language barrier. Happy times.</li>
</ul>
<p>To travel around Asia, services like <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/?z=1511837">12go</a></strong> are pure gold, as sometimes it can be challenging to buy tickets in a foreign country. Check it out!</p>
<p><strong>EXTRA TIP: Try to travel at night</strong>. We know sleeping on a bus or plane is not very comfortable, but you will save one night of accommodation. Plus, overnight trains are so romantic! If planning to visit Thailand, make sure to take a sleeper train on the classic route Bangkok &#8211; Chiang Mai. We loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, these are our rules to travel cheap. However, we want to give you an extra piece of advice&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Activities (for free)!</strong></p>
<p>Instead of splashing some cash on an expensive tour with a guide, do a quick search &#8211; chances are, there are some <strong>free city tours</strong> whenever you are!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-123" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/dsc07689-e1527181694820.jpg?w=892" alt="Rules to travel cheap: FREE activities with locals" width="554" height="360" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07689-e1527181694820.jpg 5207w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07689-e1527181694820-300x195.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07689-e1527181694820-768x498.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dsc07689-e1527181694820-1024x665.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /></p>
<p>One of the best experiences we have had so far in Vietnam was meeting Brian who showed us Hanoi on a free food tour (obviously the food was on us). He made us feel at home in a minute! By the way, that egg coffee was delicious!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What are your tricks to travel good and cheap? Please share with us!</p>

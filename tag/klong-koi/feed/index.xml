										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand?</h2>
<p>Despite the competion being fierce, we do think there are strong arguments to believe that Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand. Koh Chang is part of a small archipielago of 3 islands: Koh Chang, Koh Mak and Koh Hut, located in Trat&#8217;s province, south-east of Thailand.</p>
<h3><strong>How to get there</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately there&#8217;s no airport in Koh Chang, making it a bit tricky to get there. Your options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plane + taxi + ferry</strong>: Fly to Trat&#8217;s airport from Bangkok. Then take a taxi to the Ao Thammachat&#8217;s port, where you can reach Koh Chang by sea in 30 minutes. The boat price is 100 Bahts.</li>
<li><strong>Bus + ferry</strong>: Departing from Ekkamai&#8217;s bug station in Bangkok, there are 2 buses (Transport Co. Ltd) departing at 07:45 and 9:00. The trip takes around 6 hours and you get a yummy snack. Then just take the boat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you make it to Koh Chang, you can share a taxi with more people from the boat to make it to your hotel.</p>
<h3><strong>How to move around</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">Koh Chang is not a small island. From south to east it can easily take you one and a half hours. Your options to move around are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Taxis:</strong> The price depends on where you’re going but keep in mind they’re generally pricey.</li>
<li><strong>Renting a motorbike: </strong>The best and cheapest option if you know how to drive. Getting lost in Koh Chang driving a motorbike is one of our favourites memories from our trips around the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What to do</strong></h3>
<p>One of the things why Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand is, of course, the beaches. However, you should know Koh Chang is one of those places where you don&#8217;t really need to worry about what to do. Just ride a motorbike and GET LOST.</p>
<h4><strong>Klong Koi Beach</strong></h4>
<p>Paradise. The sand is amazing and the water is surprisingly warm. I could type here some fancy words trying to describe how good the beach is, but it wouldn&#8217;t make it justice, so just go and judge by youserlf. On your way, visit Bang Bao pier, where you can have a smoothie and do some shopping in the shops in the pier.</p>

<h4><strong>Lonely Beach</strong></h4>
<p>The beach in Lonely Beach is nothing special so you can avoid that. However, Lonely Beach is great to enjoy the food or have some drinks. The atmosphere is very chilled during the day, although in the night it can get a bit crazy as there are some parties going on.</p>
<p>Lonely beach is a great spot to enjoy sunrises. We enjoyed an awesome one in <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/warapura-resort-ko-chang.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Warapura resort</a></strong>. They have happy hours going on in the early evening, which makes it the perfect spot to see the sunset. I wanna be back so bad!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-sunset-e1582292527691.jpg" alt="koh chang sunset" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<h4><strong>White sand, Khlong Prao and Kai Bae beaches</strong></h4>
<p>You can visit all these in the same day. The first 2 are a bit touristic for our state (plus restaurants are definitely not cheap!) but in Kai Bae we had the beach for ourselves and we had a great time.</p>
<h4><strong>Kholong Phlu waterfall</strong></h4>
<p>If you get tired of beaches, you can go to Khlong Phlu, where you can have a nice short trek and enjoy the time sunbathing in a waterfall. You can dive in if you don&#8217;t mind the mind the company of the small-medium fishes!</p>
<p>All these spots are on the west side of the coast. We drove to the east side but it was definitely less worth it and we ended up turning our way around as there was pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>You can also go to Koh Mak and Koh Kut, the other islands. We&#8217;ve heard great things about them but they are a bit far so if you go, make sure you get some accommodation to spend the night and make the most of them.</p>
<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<h4><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Little Eden Bungalows</a></strong></h4>
<p class="p1">Perfect for budget travelers. Located in Lonely Beach, there are about 10 small bungalows. I would recommend it for backpackers or couples looking to stay somewhere comfortable but authentic at the same time. They have a restaurant where the food is pretty good as well. They also rent motorbikes for a good price (300 bahts).</p>

<h4><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/santhiya.en.html?aid=1593090&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2">Santhiya Tree Koh Chang Resort</a></h4>
<p>If you want to relax this is your place. Excellent location, amazing pool and in general great commodities. Live music, delicious breakfast, great sunsets, etc. An outstanding resort.</p>

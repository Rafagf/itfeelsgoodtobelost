										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Update (May 2023):</strong> This post has been updated to reflect the current information and tips for your 3 week Vietnam itinerary. Enjoy planning your adventure!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Planning a trip to Vietnam is definitely exciting. However, Vietnam is quite a big country and is hard to gauge how long you should spend in each place to make the most of it. <strong>The good news for you is that we&#8217;re here to help you organise your 3 week Vietnam itinerary.</strong> With our guide, you&#8217;ll go from north to south, but you could start in the south if it works best for you, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. Worth mentioning, we take our time when visiting places, as we don&#8217;t like visiting places just to put a tick on it.</p>
<p>But before we start&#8230;</p>
<h2>HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED?</h2>
<p>The currency is the Vietnamese Dong. You&#8217;ll get about 23,000 Dongs for a Dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 USD = 23,000 VND</p>
<p>Vietnam is a very cheap country, but it can also become expensive if you aren&#8217;t careful. Budget accommodations range between 15$ to 30$ per night, while food ranges between 2$ and 7$. If you really take good care of your money, you can allocate a 30$ budget per day. A 50$ per day budget will make a great holiday though.</p>
<ul>
<li>15$ &#8211; 30$ per night</li>
<li>2$ &#8211; 7$</li>
<li>~1$</li>
<li>TOTAL: 30$ per day</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">VISA</h2>
<p>A very important thing to double check. Vietnam is more restrictive than other countries in South East Asia. Many nationalities get a 15 days visa on arrival, but others will need to apply for it before landing in Vietnam.</p>
<p>If for example, you want to follow our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a visa. You can do it online, taking 3 days and costing you 30$. If you didn&#8217;t do your homework and you&#8217;re short on time, there are some companies who will make a visa for you in even 15 minutes, but prepare the wallet&#8230;</p>
<h2>3 WEEK VIETNAM ITINERARY</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hanoi-5.png" alt="Vietnam map" width="735" height="1102" /></p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" data-elementor-setting-key="title" data-pen-placeholder="Type Here...">Hanoi- 3 nights</h2>
<p>Hanoi is the first stop of our 3 week Vietnam itinerary. You could easily see everything in 2 days but we think you will appreciate Hanoi more if you take it easy.</p>
<p>The capital of Vietnam is one of the most lively cities we&#8217;ve ever been to. People just pass their day sitting on the street and sipping (amazing!) coffee. You will see the worst traffic you&#8217;ve ever witnessed, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. Hanoi is a beautiful city full of lovely quarters, things to do and new food to experience.</p>
<p>For a detailed guide to Hanoi &#8211; check our <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/11/04/hanoi-worth-visiting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post </a></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07840-730x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi temple" width="296" height="415" /></p>
<p>&#8211; Roam around Hoan Kiem lake. Visit Ngoc Son, a small temple situated in the middle of the lake.<br />
&#8211; Wander around the Old and French Quarters.<br />
&#8211; Visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. It&#8217;s incredible how much respect North-Vietnamese&#8217;s have for their old leader.<br />
&#8211; Visit Hoa Lo prison, colloquially known as &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;.<br />
&#8211; See the train passing on the  famous <b>&#8220;Train street&#8221; </b><br />
&#8211; We did a free food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/</a> and it was amazing. The guides are students and they will take you to places that you would not go on your own. Great way to get you started with Vietnamese&#8217;s food.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07660-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Delicious Pho!" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Don Xuan Market. You can find pretty much anything here.<br />
&#8211; Museum of Anthropology, especially interesting if you&#8217;re into finding out about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam.<br />
&#8211; Water puppet theatre.<br />
&#8211; Opera house.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: </strong>If you get to Hanoi via plane, don&#8217;t take a creepy taxi to go to the city centre. Download GRAB. It cost us 10$ to go to the city centre, 3 times cheaper than the price the taxi drivers offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07859-2-792x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi street" width="364" height="471" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/old-quarter-view-hanoi-hostel.en.html?aid=1593087&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Old Quarter View Hanoi Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, it is the perfect hostel for backpackers. Comfort and value at the same time, it has options for under 10$ a night, breakfast included.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en.html?aid=1886851&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><strong>Hanoi La Selva</strong></a></p>
<p>Great facilities and lovely staff at a very reasonable price. Gorgeous rooms and located in the Old Quarter, next to Hoan Kiem lake.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/828/82825620.jpg" alt="Hanoi La Selva" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hanoi La Selva</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Sapa -2 nights-</h2>
<p>The landscapes of the very north of Vietnam are a must see and you shouldn&#8217;t miss them. The easiest place to visit is Sapa, this comes at a cost though. We&#8217;ve heard Sapa can be very touristic and a bit fake. However, if you&#8217;re clever and book the right trekking, your experience will have nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can avoid paying one night of accommodation by taking <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">this</a></strong> very comfortable night bus.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa-1024x815.jpg" alt="Hill Tribes of Sapa" width="640" height="509" /></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our Trekking</h3>
<p>We booked a trekking called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; with <a href="http://sapaochau.org/">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a> and it was one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had when travelling. More about this <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/16/how-we-met-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">here</a> and <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O’Chau</a></strong></p>
<p>Sapa O&#8217;Chau is also a humble hotel. You can stay here the night before/after your trekking. The rooms are clean and quite cheap, so it has good value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/eco-palms-house-sapa.en.html?aid=1886846&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><b>Eco Palms House Retreat</b></a></p>
<p>For those looking for a eco retreat. Bungalows in the middle of rice-fields with amazing views to the mountain. You can also appreciate the views while sipping wine in a bath tub.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/206/206506622.jpg" alt="Eco Palms Retreat" width="1280" height="622" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Eco Palms Retreat</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ha Long Bay &#8211; 1 or 2 nights-</h2>
<p>Our 3 week Vietnam itinerary would not be complete without a visit to Ha Long Bay, one of the highlights of every visitor to Vietnam. A boat cruise will take you around the Bay for 1 or 2 nights, depending on how long you choose to stay. We&#8217;re budget travellers, so we chose 1 night. Most of the companies will include transportation from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay in the price.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written<a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/"> this post</a> about how to choose between Sapa or Ha Long Bay in case you&#8217;re short on time or budget.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Boats usually spend the night in Ha Long Bay, meaning you end up sharing the night with hundreds of boats. Some cruises take a slightly different route, sleeping in Bai Tu Long Bay. This will make your experience MUCH BETTER. Our sunset was unforgettable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08352-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa in Ha Long Bay cruise" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our choice</h3>
<p>We took the package called &#8220;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/indochina-sails-halong-city.en.html?aid=1886866&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Off the beaten track</a>&#8221; offered by Indochina Junk. With this option, you&#8217;ll spend the night in Bai Tu Long Bay. More about our experience <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ninh Binh -2 nights-</h2>
<p>We got to Ninh Binh via train from Hanoi. We had a great time biking around Tam Coc, although we were a bit unlucky as we had heavy rain for one day, meaning we couldn&#8217;t make it to the national park. Still, we had an amazing time in this beautiful countryside area.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08760-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Lake" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>&#8211; Tam Coc lake tour. One hour stroll in a small boat. The landscape is very similar to Ha Long Bay but it is still worth it.<br />
&#8211; Bich Dong Pagoda<br />
&#8211; Bird Valley<br />
&#8211; Mua cave. The cave is the least important thing, make sure you hike the mountain to get the perfect views!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08935-2-819x1024.jpg" alt="Iga in Ninh Binh" width="365" height="457" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Cuc Phong National Park.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Rent a bike (most hostels provide very cheap bikes) and cycle everywhere. The roads are very safe and the views deserve to be appreciated. You won&#8217;t get the same experience using Tuk Tuks or motorbikes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08577-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa cycling in Ninh Binh" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08480-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc's pagoda" width="640" height="360" /></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-dream-ninh-binh.en.html?aid=1588839&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Dream Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Awesome value. The location is just perfect, very close to many restaurants and attractions. The woman who runs it is great and the family, in general, will do everything they can to make you happy. They also offer cheap bikes rental and will help you booking buses to your next destination.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-horizon-bungalow.en.html?aid=1595697&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</a></strong></p>
<p>Outstanding bungalows surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible. Probably the best place to stay in Ninh Binh.</p>
<figure style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/135/135926283.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow" width="1200" height="900" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Hue -1 night-</h2>
<p>We got to Hue by night bus from Ninh Binh. Be aware the bus wasn&#8217;t particularly safe, nothing do with the one we took to go to Sapa.</p>
<p>Hue is the city of the Citadel. While the Citadel is impressive and very interesting from a historical point of view, if we had to cut down one day from our itinerary it would be Hue. Still, we had a nice day and enjoyed the city. During the night there is a nice market by the river and many nice options for dinner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09004-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hue Temple" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Hue Citadel and Forbidden City<br />
&#8211; Walk stroll next to the river. There are many markets and restaurants</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/bonjour-hostel.en.html?aid=1595705&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Bonjour Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Well located, very clean and offering rooms under 10$ the night depending on the dates. Delicious breakfast included! Just tremendous value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-scarlett-boutique.en.html?aid=1595714&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very affordable luxury rooms (about 50$ the night). One of the most visited and prestigious hotels in Hue, you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/806/80608521.jpg" alt="The Scarlett Boutique Hotel" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Hoi An -6 nights-</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09214-819x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An temple" width="435" height="545" /></p>
<p>Continuing our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, we&#8217;ll get to Hoi An. To get to this gem town, we strongly recommend the train if you come from Hue. It goes next to the Hai Van pass, a 21 km mountain pass with beautiful views to the sea.</p>
<p>Hoi An is no doubt our favourite city of Vietnam. Beach, rice fields and a beautiful old town make the city of the lanterns one of the most unique places we&#8217;ve ever visited. We have to admit we loved it so much we ended up staying for 10 days, 4 days more than we had planned.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; An Bang beach. Relaxing beach with very good and tasty restaurants. Also, you can do parasailing for 30$ 2 persons. We did it and was AMAZING.<br />
&#8211; The old town at night. Have a stroll at the old town in the night, when all the lanterns are on. Simply beautiful.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09473-e1540057985468.jpg" alt="Hoi An at night" width="478" height="382" /></p>
<p>&#8211; No better city to buy souvenirs. We bought a few too many lanterns (but we don&#8217;t regret it!).<br />
&#8211; Ride a motorbike around Hoi An. We&#8217;ll never forget the joy of riding the motorbike from the city centre to the beach, passing next to the rice fields.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09455-1024x819.jpg" alt="Hoi An lights" width="560" height="448" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Ancient town tour. Old houses, museums, Japanese covered bridge, etc.<br />
&#8211; Marble Mountains, halfway between Da Nang and Hoi An.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Motorbike is a must in Hoi An. The roads are good and traffic is more &#8220;western&#8221; than in other places of the country. Another plus: you won&#8217;t have to deal with tuk-tuk or taxi drivers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09167-672x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An river" width="431" height="656" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/melody-boutique-villa-hoi-an.en.html?aid=1602524&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Melody Boutique Villa Hoi An</a></strong></p>
<p>Modern construction, clean, fresh and very comfortable. The staff is amazing and will help you with anything you need. Bicycles and scooters available for rental at very affordable prices. Amazing value (rooms under 15$ the night).</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/little-town-villa.en.html?aid=1602527&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Little Town Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>Luxury but affordable villa in the old town. Spacious rooms and tasteful decoration. The breakfast is great, with both local and international options. Swimming pool to cool down after a long walk around the old town.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://r-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/914/91422260.jpg" alt="Little Town Villa" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Little Town Villa</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Da Lat -3 nights-</h2>
<p>Following our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, it is now time for some adventure! Da Lat is known for its hills, forests and waterfalls and it&#8217;s a place you can&#8217;t miss.</p>
<p>Must do things&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Rapelling waterfalls<br />
&#8211; Visiting Pongour Falls</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/giaphamhotel.en.html?aid=1602536&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Gia Pham Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very comfortable private room for under 8$ per night. Value doesn&#8217;t get better than this. Extremely helpful staff and very good location.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/villa-doc-may.en.html?aid=1602536&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Doc May Boutique Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>A little boutique place to an exceptional price. The villa location is great and you can walk or cycle pretty much anywhere, including the night market.</p>

<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ho Chi Minh -2 nights-</h2>

<p>The last stop of our 3 week Vietnam itinerary is Ho Chi Minh, also known as Saigon. We stayed 2 nights but 1 night-2 days works well too.</p>
<p>The capital of what it was &#8220;South Vietnam&#8221;, it is as vibrant or more than Hanoi. Also, it is a great city to learn more about Vietnam&#8217;s war with the Americans.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Walk around District 1.<br />
&#8211; Memorial war museum.<br />
&#8211; <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/15/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/">Cu Chi Tunnels</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you want to visit the real Cu Chi Tunnels, check out <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/15/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/">this post</a> to visit them on your own.</p>

<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/28/couch-surfing-in-ho-chi-minh/">Couchsurfing with Saigon English Adventures</a></strong></p>
<p>We did Couchsurfing with Saigon English Adventures English academy and absolutely loved it. You get to stay for free in exchange of being part of some English classes, where you will meet amazing locals. More about our experience <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/07/28/couch-surfing-in-ho-chi-minh/">here</a>. Honestly, this was the nicest experience we&#8217;ve had in Vietnam.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vietnam-class.jpg" alt="Our amazing Vietnamese class" width="1000" height="563" /></p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/b-amp-b-hostel-2.en.html?aid=1602543&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Boholand Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t stay here as we were Couchsurfing, but a couple of Canadian friends that we met did. Peaceful and well located in District one, close to all the main attractions. The woman who runs it apparently is very nice and the breakfast is great. Room prices are under 20$ per night</p>
<h2>Other places you could visit</h2>
<p style="color: #7a7a7a;"><strong>-Ha Giang</strong>. Not including this one in our 3 week Vietnam itinerary really hurt. This province is in the North of Vietnam, next to the Chinese border. This is a less touristic alternative to Sapa. Unfortunately, you should do it only if you have around 4-5 days, as it is very remote and takes some time to get there.</p>
<p style="color: #7a7a7a;">&#8211; <strong>Nha Trang</strong>. A coastal resort city in Southern Vietnam known for its beaches. From what we read, it is very touristic in a bad way (dirty beaches, party, etc).</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Phong Nha national park</strong>. Mountains, forest, rivers and caves. Good trekking and good adventures from our friends&#8217; experiences!</p>

				<p>Is Hanoi worth visiting? Many people ask us this question when preparing their trip to Vietnam. For us, without a doubt<strong> </strong><strong>Hanoi is worth visiting</strong>. We fell in love with this city as soon as we arrived. The traffic is the first thing that  will caught your attention, as it really is madness! The quarters are beautiful and you can see Hanoi&#8217;s history through its buildings. People sitting outside and sipping coffee all day long. And no, we are not talking about any coffee&#8230;did you know that only the coffee already makes Hanoi worth visiting? It&#8217;s amazing!</p><h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">How long should I stay?</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can tick off the main attractions in 2 nights, but if you add another night you won&#8217;t regret it.</span> Also, Hanoi is the perfect base to do trips to <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/16/how-we-met-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">Sapa</a>, <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/2018/06/19/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">Ha Long Bay</a>, Ha Giang or Ninh Binh.

Have a walk around and visit Ngog Son, a temple located on a small island in the middle of the lake. Once you&#8217;re done, please visit the &#8220;<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d3833551-Reviews-The_Note_Coffee-Hanoi.html">Note Coffee</a>&#8220;, just in the corner. It has a great variety of ice creams and coffee, and although it is a bit expensive for Vietnamese standards, it is well worth it.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-982 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07828.jpg" alt="Bridge leading to the temple, Hanoi" width="2859" height="1812" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07828.jpg 2859w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07828-300x190.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07828-768x487.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07828-1024x649.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2859px) 100vw, 2859px" /></p><h3>-Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum</h3><p>A very interesting visit from a cultural and anthropological point of view. You will be sharing your visit with hundreds of North-Vietnamese, who daily show their respect for their leader. The ticket entrance also includes a visit to Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s old residence, gardens and even cars.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Go early in the morning. Otherwise, you WILL queue for hours.</p><h3><strong>-Hoa Lo Prison</strong></h3><p>It was a prison used by the French colonists for Vietnamese political prisoners. Later, North Vietnam used it for U.S prisoners of war, such as the United States Senator John McCain. During this time, the prison got a new nickname: the Hanoi Hilton. We found a bit too much propaganda in the visit, but it is definitely a great place to learn more about Vietnam&#8217;s history.</p><h3>-Old Quarter</h3><div><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-987 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC07859-e1541936504493.jpg" alt="Old Quarter Hanoi" width="1395" height="1804" /></div><div> </div><p>The Old Quarter is the heart of Hanoi. All the markets are here, along with restaurants, old houses, museums, souvenirs shops, etc. Make sure you spend some quality time here but be aware that it can sometimes be a bit overwhelming. During the weekend, the main streets are closed at night and there is a night market.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you like homemade beer, visit Ta Hien Street, also known as beer street. One beer just 0.3$! YES, you read correctly!</p><h3>-Train street</h3><p>One of the most popular attractions of Hanoi. Two trains run daily along Le Duan and Kham Tien streets. The street is very narrow and people actually live there, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you find people sitting on a chair having their lunch on the railway or chickens running around.</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: The trains passes at 3.30pm and 7.30pm. Make sure you arrive a bit earlier to grab a nice spot!</p><h3><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-984 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08470.jpg" alt="Train Street , Hanoi" width="1952" height="2447" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08470.jpg 1952w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08470-239x300.jpg 239w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08470-768x963.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC08470-817x1024.jpg 817w" sizes="(max-width: 1952px) 100vw, 1952px" /></h3><h3> </h3><h3>Other places in Hanoi worth visiting&#8230;</h3><p><strong>-Wander around the</strong> <strong>French Quarter</strong> and enjoy the architecture</p><p><strong>-Don Xuan Market.</strong> You can find pretty much anything here. Prices are good but be aware that sellers aren&#8217;t particularly nice, we discovered this the hard way!</p><p><strong>-Museum of Anthropology</strong>. Especially interesting if you want to know about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam. Did you know there are at least 54 ethnic minorities, each with its own language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage?</p><p><strong>-Water puppet theater</strong></p><p><strong>-Opera house</strong></p><h2>Ok ok, too much sightseeing&#8230;what about trying something different?</h2><p>One of our best experiences was doing a food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/</a>. Brian, a university student from Hanoi, helped us to <strong>discover Vietnamese cuisine</strong>. We visited 5 different restaurants, and some of them were places that you probably wouldn&#8217;t visit on your own. The food was in general delicious and it was very nice to get to know someone local.</p><p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-985 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20180516_193611.jpg" alt="Free food tour in Hanoi, check our post!" width="1252" height="729" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20180516_193611.jpg 1252w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20180516_193611-300x175.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20180516_193611-768x447.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20180516_193611-1024x596.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1252px) 100vw, 1252px" /></p><p>The tour is FREE. You obviously pay for all the food (less than 15$), including your guide&#8217;s. A tip is also appreciated. You won&#8217;t regret doing the tour and it will make your trip to Vietnam easier as you will know what to order from this point.</p><p>Sooo, what are you waiting for to visit Hanoi?</p>					</div>

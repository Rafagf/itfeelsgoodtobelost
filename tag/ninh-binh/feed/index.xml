										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Updated June 2023:</strong> This post has been updated to reflect the current information and tips for your 3 week Vietnam itinerary. Enjoy planning your adventure!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Planning a trip to Vietnam is an adventure filled with excitement. However, with Vietnam&#8217;s vast landscapes and rich culture, it can be challenging to decide how long to spend in each place to truly experience its charm. <strong>The good news for you is that we&#8217;re here to help you organise your 3 week Vietnam itinerary.</strong> With our guide, you&#8217;ll go from north to south, but you could start in the south if it works best for you, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. Worth mentioning, we take our time when visiting places, as we don&#8217;t like visiting places just to put a tick on it.</p>
<p>But before we start&#8230;</p>
<h2>HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED?</h2>
<p>The currency is the Vietnamese Dong. You&#8217;ll get about 23,000 Dongs for a Dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 USD = 23,000 VND</p>
<p>Vietnam is a very cheap country, but it can also become expensive if you aren&#8217;t careful. Budget accommodations range between 15$ to 30$ per night, while food ranges between 2$ and 7$. If you really take good care of your money, you can allocate a 30$ budget per day. A 50$ per day budget will make a great holiday though.</p>
<ul>
<li>15$ &#8211; 30$ per night</li>
<li>2$ &#8211; 7$</li>
<li>~1$</li>
<li>TOTAL: 30$ per day</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">VISA</h2>
<p>A very important thing to double-check. Vietnam is more restrictive than other countries in South East Asia. Many nationalities get a 15 days visa on arrival, but others will need to apply for it before landing in Vietnam.</p>
<p>If for example, you want to follow our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a visa. You can do it online, taking 3 days and costing you 30$. If you didn&#8217;t do your homework and you&#8217;re short on time, there are some companies who will make a visa for you in even 15 minutes, but prepare the wallet&#8230;</p>
<h2>3 WEEK VIETNAM ITINERARY</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hanoi-5.png" alt="Vietnam map" width="735" height="1102" /></p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" data-elementor-setting-key="title" data-pen-placeholder="Type Here...">Hanoi- 3 nights</h2>
<p>Hanoi, the vibrant capital of Vietnam, is the first stop on our 3-week Vietnam itinerary. While it&#8217;s possible to explore the city&#8217;s highlights in 2 days, taking it easy can offer a deeper appreciation of Hanoi&#8217;s bustling life.</p>
<p>The capital of Vietnam is one of the most lively cities we&#8217;ve ever been to. People just pass their day sitting on the street and sipping (amazing!) coffee. You will see the worst traffic you&#8217;ve ever witnessed, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. Hanoi is a beautiful city full of lovely quarters, things to do and new food to experience.</p>
<p>For a detailed guide to Hanoi &#8211; check our <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/hanoi-travel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07840-730x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi temple" width="296" height="415" /></p>
<p>&#8211; Roam around Hoan Kiem lake. Visit Ngoc Son, a small temple situated in the middle of the lake.<br />
&#8211; Wander around the Old and French Quarters.<br />
&#8211; Visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. It&#8217;s incredible how much respect North-Vietnamese&#8217;s have for their old leader.<br />
&#8211; Visit Hoa Lo prison, colloquially known as &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;.<br />
&#8211; See the train passing on the  famous <b>&#8220;Train Street&#8221; </b><br />
&#8211; We did a free food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">Hanoi Free Walking Tours</a> and it was amazing. The guides are students and they will take you to places that you would not go on your own. Great way to get you started with Vietnamese food.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07660-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Delicious Pho!" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Don Xuan Market. You can find pretty much anything here.<br />
&#8211; Museum of Anthropology, especially interesting if you&#8217;re into finding out about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam.<br />
&#8211; Water puppet theatre.<br />
&#8211; Opera house.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: </strong>If you get to Hanoi via plane, don&#8217;t take a creepy taxi to go to the city centre. Download GRAB. It cost us 10$ to go to the city centre, 3 times cheaper than the price the taxi drivers offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07859-2-792x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi street" width="364" height="471" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/old-quarter-view-hanoi-hostel.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAso9AFCHW9sZC1xdWFydGVyLXZpZXctaGFub2ktaG9zdGVsSDNYBGhGiAEBmAEJuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEB-AECiAIBqAIDuAKGjs6jBsACAdICJDYxOGU2ZGU1LWJlZWEtNGI2Ni1iOTc3LTU4YTRjNGQ1YWI4MtgCBeACAQ&amp;sid=143ebf34424666d04af1f22761d460d9&amp;dist=0&amp;group_adults=1&amp;keep_landing=1&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;type=total&amp;">Old Quarter View Hanoi Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, it is the perfect hostel for backpackers. Comfort and value at the same time, it has options for under 10$ a night, breakfast included.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en-gb.html"><strong>Hanoi La Selva</strong></a></p>
<p>Great facilities and lovely staff at a very reasonable price. Gorgeous rooms and located in the Old Quarter, next to Hoan Kiem Lake.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/828/82825620.jpg" alt="Hanoi La Selva" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hanoi La Selva</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Sapa -2 nights-</h2>
<p>The landscapes of the very north of Vietnam are a must-see and you shouldn&#8217;t miss them. The easiest place to visit is Sapa, this comes at a cost though. We&#8217;ve heard Sapa can be very touristic and a bit fake. However, if you&#8217;re clever and book the right trekking, your experience will have nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can avoid paying for one night of accommodation by taking <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">this</a></strong> very comfortable night bus.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa-1024x815.jpg" alt="Hill Tribes of Sapa" width="640" height="509" /></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our Trekking</h3>
<p>We booked a trek called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; with <a href="http://sapaochau.org/">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a> and it was one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had when travelling. More about this <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/trekking-and-homestay-with-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">here</a> and <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://sapaochau.org/contact-us/booking/">Sapa O’Chau</a></strong></p>
<p>Sapa O&#8217;Chau is also a humble hotel. You can stay here the night before/after your trekking. The rooms are clean and quite cheap, so it has good value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/eco-palms-house-sapa"><b>Eco Palms House Retreat</b></a></p>
<p>For those looking for an eco-retreat. Bungalows in the middle of rice fields with amazing views of the mountain. You can also appreciate the views while sipping wine in a bathtub.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/206/206506622.jpg" alt="Eco Palms Retreat" width="1280" height="622" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Eco Palms Retreat</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ha Long Bay &#8211; 1 or 2 nights-</h2>
<p>Our 3 week Vietnam itinerary would not be complete without a visit to Ha Long Bay, one of the highlights of every visitor to Vietnam. A boat cruise will take you around the Bay for 1 or 2 nights, depending on how long you choose to stay. We&#8217;re budget travellers, so we chose 1 night. Most of the companies will include transportation from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay in the price.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">this post</a> about how to choose between Sapa or Ha Long Bay in case you&#8217;re short on time or budget.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Boats usually spend the night in Ha Long Bay, meaning you end up sharing the night with hundreds of boats. Some cruises take a slightly different route, sleeping in Bai Tu Long Bay. This will make your experience MUCH BETTER. Our sunset was unforgettable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08352-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa in Ha Long Bay cruise" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Our choice</h3>
<p>We took the package called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; offered by <a href="https://www.indochina-junk.com/">Indochina Junk</a>. With this option, you&#8217;ll spend the night in Bai Tu Long Bay.</p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ninh Binh -2 nights-</h2>
<p>We got to Ninh Binh via train from Hanoi. We had a great time biking around Tam Coc, although we were a bit unlucky as we had heavy rain for one day, meaning we couldn&#8217;t make it to the national park. Still, we had an amazing time in this beautiful countryside area.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08760-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Lake" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>&#8211; Tam Coc Lake tour. One hour stroll in a small boat. The landscape is very similar to Ha Long Bay but it is still worth it.<br />
&#8211; Bich Dong Pagoda<br />
&#8211; Bird Valley<br />
&#8211; Mua cave. The cave is the least important thing, make sure you hike the mountain to get the perfect views!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08935-2-819x1024.jpg" alt="Iga in Ninh Binh" width="365" height="457" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Cuc Phong National Park.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Rent a bike (most hostels provide very cheap bikes) and cycle everywhere. The roads are very safe and the views deserve to be appreciated. You won&#8217;t get the same experience using Tuk Tuks or motorbikes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08577-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa cycling in Ninh Binh" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08480-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc's pagoda" width="640" height="360" /></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-horizon-bungalow.en.html?aid=1595697&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</a></strong></p>
<p>Outstanding bungalows surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible. Probably the best place to stay in Ninh Binh.</p>
<figure style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/135/135926283.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow" width="1200" height="900" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Hue -1 night-</h2>
<p>We got to Hue by night bus from Ninh Binh. Be aware the bus wasn&#8217;t particularly safe, nothing to do with the one we took to go to Sapa.</p>
<p>Hue is the city of the Citadel. While the Citadel is impressive and very interesting from a historical point of view, if we had to cut down one day from our itinerary it would be Hue. Still, we had a nice day and enjoyed the city. During the night there is a nice market by the river and many nice options for dinner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09004-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hue Temple" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Hue Citadel and Forbidden City<br />
&#8211; Walk stroll next to the river. There are many markets and restaurants</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/bonjour-hostel.en.html?aid=1595705&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Bonjour Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Well located, very clean and offers rooms under 10$ the night depending on the dates. Delicious breakfast included! Just has tremendous value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-scarlett-boutique.en.html?aid=1595714&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very affordable luxury rooms (about 50$ the night). One of the most visited and prestigious hotels in Hue, you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/806/80608521.jpg" alt="The Scarlett Boutique Hotel" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Hoi An -6 nights-</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09214-819x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An temple" width="435" height="545" /></p>
<p>Continuing our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, we&#8217;ll get to Hoi An. To get to this gem town, we strongly recommend the train if you come from Hue. It goes next to the Hai Van Pass, a 21 km mountain pass with beautiful views of the sea.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Hoi An is our favourite city in Vietnam. With its pristine beaches, lush rice fields, and a beautiful old town illuminated by lanterns, Hoi An offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage that we found truly captivating.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; An Bang beach. Relaxing beach with very good and tasty restaurants. Also, you can do parasailing for 30$ 2 people. We did it and was AMAZING.<br />
&#8211; The old town at night. Have a stroll in the old town at night, when all the lanterns are on. Simply beautiful.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09473-e1540057985468.jpg" alt="Hoi An at night" width="478" height="382" /></p>
<p>&#8211; No better city to buy souvenirs. We bought a few too many lanterns (but we don&#8217;t regret it!).<br />
&#8211; Ride a motorbike around Hoi An. We&#8217;ll never forget the joy of riding the motorbike from the city centre to the beach, passing next to the rice fields.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09455-1024x819.jpg" alt="Hoi An lights" width="560" height="448" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Other things you could do&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Ancient town tour. Old houses, museums, Japanese covered bridge, etc.<br />
&#8211; Marble Mountains, halfway between Da Nang and Hoi An.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Motorbike is a must in Hoi An. The roads are good and traffic is more &#8220;western&#8221; than in other places of the country. Another plus: you won&#8217;t have to deal with tuk-tuk or taxi drivers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09167-672x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An river" width="431" height="656" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/melody-boutique-villa-hoi-an">Melody Boutique Villa Hoi An</a></strong></p>
<p>Modern construction, clean, fresh and very comfortable. The staff is amazing and will help you with anything you need. Bicycles and scooters are available for rental at very affordable prices. Amazing value (rooms under 15$ the night).</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/little-town-villa">Little Town Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>Luxury but an affordable villa in the old town. Spacious rooms and tasteful decoration. The breakfast is great, with both local and international options. Swimming pool to cool down after a long walk around the old town.</p>
<figure style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://r-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/914/91422260.jpg" alt="Little Town Villa" width="1280" height="853" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Little Town Villa</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Da Lat -3 nights-</h2>
<p>As we continue our 3-week Vietnam itinerary, it&#8217;s time for an exhilarating adventure! Da Lat, renowned for its rolling hills, verdant forests, and stunning waterfalls, is an unmissable destination for nature lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Must do things:</p>
<p>&#8211; Rapelling waterfalls<br />
&#8211; Visiting Pongour Falls</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/giaphamhotel">Gia Pham Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very comfortable private room for under 8$ per night. Value doesn&#8217;t get better than this. Extremely helpful staff and a very good location.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/villa-doc-may">Doc May Boutique Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>A little boutique place at an exceptional price. The villa location is great and you can walk or cycle pretty much anywhere, including the night market.</p>
<figure style="width: 552px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/138/138005574.jpg" alt="Doc May Boutique Villa" width="552" height="415" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Doc May Boutique Villa</figcaption></figure>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Ho Chi Minh -2 nights-</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07769-1024x711.jpg" alt="Ho Chi Minh's market" width="640" height="444" /></p>
<p>The last stop of our 3 week Vietnam itinerary is Ho Chi Minh, also known as Saigon. We stayed 2 nights but 1 night-2 days works well too.</p>
<p>The capital of what it was &#8220;South Vietnam&#8221;, it is as vibrant or more than Hanoi. Also, it is a great city to learn more about Vietnam&#8217;s war with the Americans.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Must do things&#8230;</h3>
<p>&#8211; Walk around District 1.<br />
&#8211; Memorial war museum.<br />

<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/couchsurfing-in-ho-chi-minh/">Couchsurfing with Saigon English Adventures</a></strong></p>
<p>We did Couchsurfing with Saigon English Adventures English Academy and absolutely loved it. You get to stay for free in exchange for being part of some English classes, where you will meet amazing locals. More about our experience <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/couchsurfing-in-ho-chi-minh/">here</a>. Honestly, this was the nicest experience we&#8217;ve had in Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Other places you could visit</h2>
<p style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-Ha Giang</strong>. Not including this one in our 3 week Vietnam itinerary really hurt. This province is in the North of Vietnam, next to the Chinese border. This is a less touristic alternative to Sapa. Unfortunately, you should do it only if you have around 4-5 days, as it is very remote and takes some time to get there.</span></p>
<p style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; <strong>Nha Trang</strong>. A coastal resort city in Southern Vietnam known for its beaches. From what we read, it is very tourist in a bad way (dirty beaches, parties, etc).</span></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Phong Nha national park</strong>. Mountains, forests, rivers and caves. Good trekking and good adventures from our friends&#8217; experiences!</p>

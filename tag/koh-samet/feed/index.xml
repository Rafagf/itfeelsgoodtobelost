										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><strong>U</strong><b>pdated in 2023</b>: This post has been updated to ensure it contains the most accurate and comprehensive guide for exploring Koh Samet. Enjoy planning your adventure!</i></p>
<p>Embarking on an adventure exploring Koh Samet, a lovely island nestled in the Gulf of Thailand, is a perfect escape from the bustling city of Bangkok. This comprehensive travel guide will help you navigate through the island&#8217;s pristine beaches, amazing sunsets, and vibrant nightlife. Koh Samet is still a hidden gem, so make sure you explore this paradise before it becomes another crowded island!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are like us and made the mistake to spend some days in Pattaya you&#8217;ll find exploring Koh Samet a refreshing experience.<span id="more-68"></span></p>
<h3><strong>How to get there?</strong></h3>
<p>We went to Koh Samet from Pattaya. If you&#8217;re going from Bangkok, I&#8217;d expect there are buses from Ekkamai bus station to Ban Phe port. Worst scenario, you could easily go to Pattaya and then go to Ban Phe. This is how we did it from Pattaya:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to this <strong style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Praew+Souvenir+@Tesco+Lotus+Central+Pattaya/@12.9337661,100.9025029,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3102be1c9a4d3ec5:0xade9af5b32c85c66!2sPattaya+Bus+station!8m2!3d12.9499477!4d100.9033208!3m4!1s0x310295f03b6ec8e3:0x26063f5fe5264481!8m2!3d12.9337639!4d100.9034285">location</a></strong>. In front of the Tesco Lotus, there is a <b style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">small travel office that organizes trips by van.</b></li>
<li>Tell them you want to go to <strong>Ban-Phe port</strong> to then go to Koh Samet<b>.</b> The trip takes an hour and it costs 300 bahts (2 people).</li>
<li>Once in the port, walk to the ticket office. There are slow and fast boats. We took a fast boat, which after haggling a bit, cost us 250 bahts (2 people).</li>
<li>A short 15-minute ride later, you&#8217;ll arrive at Koh Samet. A coast guard will approach you to collect the national park fee, which is 200 baht. Rest assured, exploring Koh Samet is worth every penny!</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>How to move around</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The island is fairly small, but you&#8217;ll need transport to move around. Options are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hopping in big taxis that move around the island all day.</strong> The price depends on where you&#8217;re going but keep in mind they&#8217;re generally pricey.</li>
<li><strong>Rent a bike and cycle around!</strong> Ecological and cheap.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our favorite: hire a motorbike </strong>(250 bahts per day). Only for those who know how to drive. If you&#8217;re a beginner, you should be fine as it is quite easy to drive in Koh Samet. Drive safely!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A few things to convince you why exploring Koh Samet is worth it</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hat Sai Kaew Beach</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most popular beach. During the day expect a lot of people, towels, activities like snorkeling and so on.  In the night the atmosphere is stunning: nice restaurants, fire shows, relaxed parties, locals hanging out&#8230;</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/koh-samet-bar.png" alt="Naga Bar" width="655" height="471" /></h3>

<h3><strong>Ao Prao beach</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Simply</strong> <strong>paradise</strong>. Surrounded by resorts, but don&#8217;t let this put you off. The water is a stunning shade of blue and crystal clear, and the sand couldn&#8217;t be any whiter. We&#8217;ve visited quite a few beaches, and this is one of our favorites. Plus, we got to witness one of the most beautiful sunsets we&#8217;ve ever seen. Pictures simply don&#8217;t do it justice—you&#8217;ll have to go and see it for yourself!</p>
<figure id="attachment_84" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-samet2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Koh Samet is worth a visit" width="690" height="460" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-caption-text">This sunset alone shows Koh Samet is worth a visit</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Wat Koh Samet</h3>
<p>Buddism is an important part of the local culture, so if you want to experience that, the temple complex in the middle of the village called Wat Koh Samet is worth a visit. <strong>After climbing a few stars, you will find the famous big Buddha statue there. </strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_93" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93" style="width: 449px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-samet61-e1570995284982.jpg" alt="Koh Samet Wat" width="449" height="589" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-93" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure to stop on your way to visit the Big Buddha in Koh Samet Wat</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are a morning person <strong>you may be lucky to see monks walking down the streets and receiving alms</strong>, as the practice of offering food is called. Mothers have been cooking food for monks and giving alms since the dawn of Buddhism over 2,500 years ago!</p>
<figure id="attachment_92" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92" style="width: 3114px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_20180318_112606.jpg" alt="Monks in the morning" width="3114" height="2715" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-92" class="wp-caption-text">Monks receiving alms in the morning</figcaption></figure>

<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Budget option: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/stay-samed">Stay Samet</a></strong></h4>

They offer both shared and private rooms that are clean and comfortable. The on-site restaurant serves a variety of healthy and delicious food. The reception staff is friendly and always ready to assist with anything. Plus, the location is excellent, with many shops and restaurants nearby.</p>
<h4><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/samed-villa-resort">Samed Villa Resort</a></h4>

This outstanding resort is located right in front of Ao Phai Beach, providing direct access to the beach. You can enjoy the best sunsets right from the resort! The rooms are stylish and clean, and don&#8217;t forget to indulge in their massage service!</p>
<h2>How to come back to Bangkok?</h2>
<p>All good comes to an end. Head to the pier and hop on the first departing boat to come back to the mainland<b>.</b> There are boats departing every hour. The slow one is 50 bahts and takes about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>There are buses heading to Bangkok </strong>at the bus station next to the pier<b>. </b>The price is 150 baths and the drop-off point is Ekkamai Bus Station.</p>
<p>To sum it up, exploring Koh Samet is an adventure worth undertaking, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did</p>

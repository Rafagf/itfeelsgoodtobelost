There are horror stories online about crossing the Cambodian border from Thailand (and the other way around) by this town. I&#8217;m not going to list them as the Internet is flooded with posts about it, but I&#8217;ll share our experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spoiler alert: It wasn&#8217;t as bad as they say it is!<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Before crossing the Cambodian border<\/h2>\n<p>We were in <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/best-things-to-do-in-koh-chang\/\" data-wplink-url-error=\"true\"><strong>Koh Chang<\/strong><\/a>, an island on the Gulf of Thailand. We decided to travel to Cambodia, due to its proximity and to visit <strong>Angkor Wat<\/strong>, one of the most amazing monuments in the world.<\/p>\n<p>While In Ko Chang, we stayed at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/th\/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\"><strong>Little Eden Bungalows<\/strong><\/a>, a beautiful backpackers bungalow resort, where we were offered transportation to Siem Reap (the city where Angkor Wat is) through an external Thai company. The receptionist recommended not do the whole trip with them and get a taxi as soon as we reached Cambodia. This way we would avoid scams like: &#8220;Sorry the bus is broken, you all need to get these expensive taxis waiting conveniently for you in this corner&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We had also read online to not even complete the whole trip in Thai side with them. They would do a stop before crossing the Cambodian border in a restaurant a few kilometres\u00a0away, collecting everyone&#8217;s passports and forcing you to get the Cambodian visa through an unofficial office where you end up paying up to two times more!<\/p>\n<p>The list of scams goes on and on, but we still decided to go for it. It was much cheaper and comfortable than coming all the way back to Bangkok and fly to Siem Reap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIP: Don&#8217;t overread online about crossing the Cambodian border.\u00a0<\/strong>YES, you need to do to make sure you read a bit to have everything under control. Once you&#8217;ve done that, stop reading. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be like me; worried to death the night before and asking yourself why on earth you would do something like that. IT WILL BE OK \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h2>The CROSSING day<\/h2>\n<p>In the morning, a mini-van picked us up at 7 AM. The guy didn&#8217;t seem very friendly, but who cares, right? After picking up some tourists we made it to the pier, where we waited 30 minutes for the ferry. 45 minutes later we had made it to the mainland.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-191 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/koh-chang101.jpg\" alt=\"crossing the cambodian border: ready!\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Back in the mini-van, we had a 3 hours drive ahead of us to\u00a0<strong>Aranyaprathet<\/strong>, the Thai town where the border is. Turned up the stories were right and the guys took us to a restaurant where we &#8220;<em>would have lunch before going to the visa office<\/em>&#8220;. We said <em>&#8220;nope, thank you, we&#8217;ll walk&#8221;,<\/em> got our luggage and started walking. We had read they could get pushy when doing this but they were totally ok with it.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, it was recommended to get a Tuk Tuk to the border, as the town is supposed to be dangerous. We didn&#8217;t see any (plus they would try to take us to the &#8220;unofficial office&#8221; to scam us), so we just walked. The town wasn&#8217;t\u00a0<em>nice<\/em> but it didn&#8217;t feel dangerous either. Thai people taking care of their business and not a single person said anything to us. After 15 minutes we made it to the border. Happy times!<\/p>\n<p>We were expecting long queues\u00a0but it was clear we were way ahead than most of the tourists, which were probably stuck &#8220;having lunch&#8221;. In less than 10-15 minutes we had our leaving stamp in the passport and we were in Poipet, Cambodia.<\/p>\n<p>Once there, some guys tried to help us out with our transport to Siem Reap as they &#8220;knew someone who could take us very cheap&#8221;. After ignoring them, we walked to the Visa Cambodian office where we would get our visa. Funny enough, we found again an empty office, full of Cambodian officers (around 10) and maybe 3-4 tourists. We filled up the requested documents, handed it to the officers along with a photo and&#8230;it was scam time again!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The visa price is officially 30$<\/strong>, and even in the office, there is a big sign that says the same thing, 30$. We had read they would ask for more money and turned out to be right. The officer pointed to a very lame paper where we could read: <em>&#8220;30$ + 100 Baths&#8221;<\/em> (Bath is the Thai currency, 100 baths are about 3$). We said <em>&#8220;nope, it&#8217;s only 30$, is written there&#8221;<\/em>, but the\u00a0guy didn&#8217;t even blink and repeated &#8220;<em>100 Baths<\/em>&#8220;. We tried to make him understand but he left us no choice, so we gave him the 100 baths.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Trying to avoid the scam wasn&#8217;t really about the money but about playing by the book. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have enough patience. If you hand out the 30$, sit and wait, after some time they will give you the visa. Who knows how long you will wait though.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We walked a bit more and pass around a few casinos where Thai people gamble as it&#8217;s illegal in Thailand. Next step was to get the Cambodia entering stamp in our passport, which went quite smoothly. A random guy offered me a pen\u00a0and of course, it turned out he knew a guy that would take us very cheap to Siem Reap. We got our stamps in our passports, walked out of the office and the &#8220;pen guy&#8221; was waiting for us. He offered a price of 45$ to\u00a0<em>our hotel\u00a0<\/em>(we were 3, as Nicky, an American friend we had met in Koh Chang, had joined us). After negotiating a bit, we agreed on 40$ (13$ each) and we were on our way to Siem Reap.<\/p>\n<h2>Crossing the Cambodian border: CHECKED!<\/h2>\n<p>So far so good! But we knew it wasn&#8217;t over yet. Turns out you can&#8217;t really trust these guys at all. He didn&#8217;t take us to our hotels, but to a random place in the city where a guy in his Tuk Tuk came to pick us up. He would only take us for free if we hired him for the next day to visit Angkor Wat.<\/p>\n<p>We said no and started to negotiate prices again. Our friend Nicky was staying in a different hostel, meaning the guy wasn&#8217;t happy about doing 2 stops. He wanted us to pay 5$ each to take us to the hostels (15$ in total), but we said we would take another Tuk Tuk and he finally settled in 10$. We would later find out that was still very pricey, but at that moment we didn&#8217;t care. 15 minutes later,<strong> we made it to our hostel safe and sound<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>Summing up, if you&#8217;re thinking about crossing the Cambodian border by land, <strong>don&#8217;t stress and do it<\/strong>, it&#8217;s fine! We left Koh Chang at 7 AM and arrived at our hostel in Siem Reap at 5 PM<strong>. <\/strong>I can&#8217;t say it was a pleasant journey but it wasn&#8217;t that bad and<strong> it turned out to be a bit of fun.<\/strong> It&#8217;s sad neither the Thai nor Cambodian governments care about tourists being scammed as soon as they enter their countries. This shouldn&#8217;t stop you from enjoying what really is a beautiful country with beautiful people!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Accommodation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for accommodation, we stayed at <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/kh\/velkommen-boutique-villa.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\">Velkommen Guesthouse<\/a>.<\/strong> It was cheap, nice (swimming pool!) and well located as it&#8217;s closer to Angkor Wat than most of the hostels. They provide free bikes so you can cycle to the city centre (10 minutes) or to Angkor Wat! 100% recommended it!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-215\" src=\"https:\/\/itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/img_20180331_092445.jpg\" alt=\"crossing the cambodian border: safe and sound :)\" width=\"467\" height=\"831\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180331_092445.jpg 1166w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180331_092445-169x300.jpg 169w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180331_092445-768x1365.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180331_092445-576x1024.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have ever heard about a town called Poipet, the chances are you didn&#8217;t hear anything good about it.

She offers free accommodation at her place in exchange for volunteering in a few English classes with her students. We aren&#8217;t native speakers but we thought it should be good fun, so we applied. Thao promptly came back approving the stay. We were going to spend a few days interacting with Vietnamese people, exciting times!<\/p>\n<p>She told us she would be away most of our stay as she was on holidays, so her roommate Jane would really be our host. We landed in Saigon from Da Nang at midnight, hopped into a Grab heading to the provided address.\u00a0Jane picked us up with a huge smile and took us home.\u00a0We would be sleeping in the living room, that turned out to be also the English school classroom!<\/p>\n<h2>Visiting Saigon<\/h2>\n<p>Next day we woke up early and went out to do some sightseeing. We walked to the city center (also called District 1) to discover a bit of Saigon, a unique city. Crazy traffic with motorbikes everywhere, chickens in the street, motorbike taxi drivers taking naps on their bikes, etc. A huge pink Catholic church caught our attention, as we had never seen one like it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-569 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Pink church in Saigon\" width=\"527\" height=\"937\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg 576w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DSC09590-169x300.jpg 169w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DSC09590-768x1365.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DSC09590.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After walking a while we got to the War Memorial Museum. There we had another lesson of how sad and unnecessary wars are. For lunch, we got some cheap Pho, you can&#8217;t beat the price! (30 Vietnamese dongs = 1.5$).<\/p>\n<p>From lunch to evening we wandered around the city center, where we found the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/the-strangest-protest-ever\/\" data-wplink-url-error=\"true\">strangest protest we have ever witnessed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Next day we woke up early to visit the Cu Chi tunnels, one of the most popular attractions in Vietnam. If you want to read about this or you want to know how to visit the Cu Chi tunnels on our own, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own\/\" data-wplink-url-error=\"true\">visit this post.<\/a>\u00a0Once back from the tunnels, the most exciting part of the trip was about to start: English classes!<\/p>\n<h2>English classes<\/h2>\n<p>Jane told us the English teacher couldn&#8217;t make it to the class, meaning we had to drive the class with her help. Iga got a bit stressed about it but I was fine with it, I knew it was going to be so much fun!<\/p>\n<p>One by one, the students started arriving. They were more or less on our age, a bit younger maybe. And you can&#8217;t imagine how cute they were! Their English was limited but they could communicate, especially because they were not shy at all, which makes everything much easier. The class ended up being 2 hours of &#8220;Ask me anything&#8221; and it was just so much fun. We also got to know a bit about each of them and we can tell they are beautiful people.<\/p>\n<p>After the class, they invited us for dinner at a very Vietnamese restaurant. They ordered so much traditional food, which we obviously appreciated as sometimes can be daunting to try new food in exotic countries. We drank, laughed, ate, exchanged social media profiles, life experiences&#8230;and that was it! At the end of the night we were so happy with the experience, and also a bit sad because we could not stay any longer with them.<\/p>\n<p>Next day we woke up and met Thao, the Couchsurfing host and the director of the school. We got to chat a bit with her, enough to be inspired by the happiness she emits. After having breakfast, we assisted her with a new English class. This group&#8217;s level was very basic, plus you could tell they weren&#8217;t very used to be with foreign people, so they were a bit shy. Still, it was also a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p>Spending the weekend Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh was an amazing experience. It was exactly what we look for when traveling: visiting new places and meeting inspiring people, like Thao, Jane or their students. What about you? What do you look for when traveling?<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dinner with: Saigon English Adventures\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/HyFaMYQMASI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"r\"><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Few days before our one month visa in Vietnam expired, we decided to finish our north-to-south trip doing something special: we wanted to spend our last days\u00a0Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh.\u00a0This would give us the chance to spend some quality time with locals, something that we hadn&#8217;t managed so far for one reason or another.

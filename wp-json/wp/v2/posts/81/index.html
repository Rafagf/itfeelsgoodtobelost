When explaining to some acquaintances how long we were gonna travel for, some of them would react like &#8220;<em>Wow, you guys are loaded!<\/em>&#8220;. We are far from being loaded! The funny thing is, those who say that probably go on holidays for 2 weeks, spending the same money than us in 2 months! That&#8217;s why we want to share our 3 rules to travel cheap!<\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ve discovered that spending more money usually doesn&#8217;t make your trip any better, in fact, if anything, it makes it less authentic.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I only have 2 weeks of holidays per year.

Choose your destination wisely<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, your holidays are going to depend a lot on the country you are at. It&#8217;s not the same to visit Myanmar than visiting Switzerland. Whenever you go somewhere expensive, be aware that there is a tradeoff&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Moving by taxi if you feel tired vs public transport, meaning you end up exhausted every day<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Eating wherever you feel into vs. eating in McDonald&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t afford anything else (e.g. Hong Kong is famous for its super cheap Michelin Star restaurants!)<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Boat to that magic cave + kayaking + cooking lesson + motorbike tour vs free walking tour around the city<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">You get the idea&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_122\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-122\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-122\" src=\"https:\/\/itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/img_20180421_094233.jpg\" alt=\"Rules to travel cheap: Don't do Japanese trains\" width=\"278\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180421_094233.jpg 3000w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180421_094233-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/img_20180421_094233-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-122\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two-week railway pass in Japan can ruin anyone&#8217;s budget&#8230; BTW, bullet trains are amazing \ud83d\ude42<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thus, one of the most important rules to travel cheap is to <strong>choose countries that are considered cheap for your budget<\/strong>. This does not mean you can&#8217;t go to, let&#8217;s say Japan, for 3 weeks and still make it affordable like we did.&nbsp; However, for the same money, you could spend 6 weeks in Thailand without counting every penny!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Accommodation<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The next of our rules to travel cheap is to&nbsp;<strong>stay away from hotels<\/strong>. Hotels are usually expensive and they are not worth the money. Plus, who wants to stay in a room where you can&#8217;t really tell which country you are at? We like to have a local experience, which hotels don&#8217;t really give you.

Say hi to new neighbours, get a morning coffee in the local shop, warm baguettes from the bakery around the corner, and fresh fruits from the food market nearby. We love to cook from time to time, it is a DIY way to experiment with the local cuisine and try out some new recipes.<\/p>\n<p>Hosts usually try to help you as much as possible to get a positive review, so it&#8217;s a win-win. Fair to be said, Airbnb is not super cheap and the hassle of checking in\/out it&#8217;s usually not worth it for short stays (1-2 nights).

If you are thinking about staying 5-6 days, check how much would it be 7 days, as it may even be cheaper! Same thing with monthly stays.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.booking.com\/index.html?aid=1530604\">Booking.com<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We use any of these services for short stays. If you are going 2 days-1 night somewhere, you aren&#8217;t going to spend much time in your room. Thus, just get something cheap, well-located, clean and move on. You really don&#8217;t need that Smart TV, you have it at home!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TIP:<\/strong> Also, if possible, <strong>book&nbsp;your accommodation only a few days before arriving at your destination.<\/strong> Why? Hosts lose money when they have their place empty so they will be happy offering discounts. You may get up to 30-40% discount on the price!

Transport<\/h2>\n<p>The last of our rules to travel cheap is, of course, related to transport. Some tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t buy <strong>flights<\/strong> that are out of your budget. If possible, change your itinerary so you can fly cheaper. Never buy a flight without tracking for a few days how the price oscillates. Setting a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tkqlhce.com\/click-8801912-10641620\"><strong>Skyscanner<\/strong><\/a> alarm for a flight or Kayak &#8220;buy&#8221; advice are usually very useful.<\/li>\n<li>Whenever possible, take <strong>buses<\/strong> as they are way cheaper than planes.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Using a regular <strong>taxi<\/strong> in, let&#8217;s say Bangkok, it&#8217;s pretty challenging, and you&#8217;re very likely to get ripped off. Use <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/invite\/wted3\">Uber<\/a><\/strong> or <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/r.grab.com\/grabrafapiki\">Grab<\/a><\/strong>. These apps make it really easy and they remove the language barrier. Happy times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To travel around Asia, services like <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/12go.asia\/?z=1511837\">12go<\/a><\/strong> are pure gold, as sometimes it can be challenging to buy tickets in a foreign country. Check it out!<\/p>\n<p><strong>EXTRA TIP: Try to travel at night<\/strong>. We know sleeping on a bus or plane is not very comfortable, but you will save one night of accommodation. Plus, overnight trains are so romantic! If planning to visit Thailand, make sure to take a sleeper train on the classic route Bangkok &#8211; Chiang Mai. We loved it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ok, these are our rules to travel cheap. However, we want to give you an extra piece of advice&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Activities (for free)!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Instead of splashing some cash on an expensive tour with a guide, do a quick search &#8211; chances are, there are some <strong>free city tours<\/strong> whenever you are!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-123\" src=\"https:\/\/itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/dsc07689-e1527181694820.jpg?w=892\" alt=\"Rules to travel cheap: FREE activities with locals\" width=\"554\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dsc07689-e1527181694820.jpg 5207w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dsc07689-e1527181694820-300x195.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dsc07689-e1527181694820-768x498.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dsc07689-e1527181694820-1024x665.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the best experiences we have had so far in Vietnam was meeting Brian who showed us Hanoi on a free food tour (obviously the food was on us).

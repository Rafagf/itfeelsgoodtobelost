And meeting the Hill Tribes of Sapa was on my bucket list for Vietnam!<\/p><div dir=\"auto\"><div dir=\"auto\">Before going to Sapa, a town in the North of Vietnam, we were warned that it is packed with tourists and locals doing everything to sell you &#8220;handmade&#8221; souvenirs. Which, by the way, proved true.\u00a0<strong>But if you only dare to go off the beaten track like we did, you will be able to discover the <em>real<\/em> hill tribes.<\/strong><\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">Kids walking their buffalo at the dusk, men working in the rice fields. Mothers with their babies waving to you from their homes. Idyllic. All of them wearing traditional clothes &#8211; not for tourists, but because this is how things were since they came to Vietnam from China ages ago.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><\/div><div dir=\"auto\">Get lost and discover the authentic life of Hill Tribes of Sapa, this world will mesmerise you.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><div dir=\"auto\"><p>The price you will pay is sweat, sweat and sweat. Hills are difficult to climb in a summer heat, but that only makes you appreciate the breathtaking views of the rice fields mountains even more.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-874 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sapa7.jpg\" alt=\"Sapa rice fields\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sapa7.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/sapa7-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p><\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><h1>We met the authentic Hill Tribes of Sapa thanks to Xuan, our guide from the Red Dao tribe<\/h1><p>Like most girls in the village, she got married when she was very young. In many villages there is a place called &#8220;love market&#8221;, where teenagers are allowed to meet and get to know each other with the permission of their parents. If they fell in love and feel like it is a good match, the boy asks parents to marry their daughter. And her parents accepted.<\/p><p>In a patriarchal society, the bride always moves in with the groom&#8217;s parents. Imagine you are preparing a lunch for the whole family, and you don&#8217;t know how to pack rice in the banana leaves. I asked: &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you ask your mother how to do that?&#8221;. &#8220;There was no phone in the village, and I had moved far away from my family, so I had to learn by myself&#8221;, she said. And this is pretty much the definition of Xuan &#8211; all she achieved is thanks to herself!<\/p><\/div><h1 dir=\"auto\">Every tribe has its own traditional textiles and clothing<\/h1><div dir=\"auto\">Parents rarely refuse the marriage, if so, it is probably because the boy is from another village or tribe. You would say, &#8220;why does it matter if they live next to each other anyway?&#8221;<\/div><strong><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-361 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/dsc08147-731x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"166\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/dsc08147-731x1024.jpg 731w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/dsc08147-214x300.jpg 214w, http:\/\/localhost:8888\/itfeelsgoodtobelost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/dsc08147-768x1075.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px\" \/><\/strong><div dir=\"auto\"><strong>In the Dao culture where worshipping your ancestors is the main religion (shamanism), providing the continuity of tradition is almost an obligation.\u00a0<\/strong>On a very rare occasion, the young wife coming from a different tribe will learn it the hard way. Among many things, wife&#8217;s responsibility is to make traditional handmade clothes for the family, and as they vary a lot between tribes, she would be in a pickle.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">Honestly, the level of detail and embroidery is outstanding. <strong>Look at that dress Xuan made herself for her little daughter. It took her over 3 months!<\/strong><\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><h1 dir=\"auto\">Shamanism in practice<\/h1><div dir=\"auto\">For all Hill Tribes of Sapa ancestors blessing is important, it can provide you with a happy life. You have to watch out not to mistreat them (I am talking about <em>ghosts<\/em>, yes). <b>For example, after finishing your meal in the fields you should never leave banana leaves (with rests from the meal) in a place where buffalo can eat them.<\/b> You are not wrong, buffalo&#8217;s stomach can take some banana leaves with rice pretty well, however it would mean that ancestors will get full and won&#8217;t &#8220;send&#8221; any food for their family.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">As we passed by a dead snake on our hike, I asked Xuan if there is any animal that they consider particularly important. She said &#8220;buffalo&#8221;. The surprising connection between buffalo getting his stomach full and ancestors not being hungry anymore would most surely confirm that!<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-378 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/06\/dsc08160.jpg\" alt=\"DSC08160\" width=\"593\" height=\"396\" \/><\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><p>We were able to ask her all sorts of things, as her English is amazingly good,\u00a0 especially for someone who went only to a primary school because parents could not afford her further education.\u00a0She is the only person in the whole village that speaks English and she learned it herself by memorizing a new word every day (no Internet in the village FYI!).<\/p><\/div><h1 dir=\"auto\">Discovering feminism in Hill Tribes of Sapa<\/h1><\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><div dir=\"auto\"><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Until now, no one in the village (apart from her husband) comprehends completely what she is doing.

She just laughs at that. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">A tender, loving mother and an amazing wife.

It is easy to refuse everything that culture enforces on you as a woman like we can afford to do nowadays in a western world. Be as independent, manly, strong as we want.

The trekking starts in a small village and you will be the only tourist there (it is truly off the beaten track). There are 17 km of hiking ahead of you, but the views will make it worth!\u00a0The journey will take you thorough mountains, valleys, forests and terraced rice fields.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\"><b>TIP:<\/b><\/div><div dir=\"auto\">Because the trekking will last the whole day, wear comfortable clothes and shoes and don&#8217;t take a massive backpack. You won&#8217;t need much anyway- clothes for the next day, basic toiletry and a camera to capture these amazing views! Don&#8217;t forget the sunscreen.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">You will have lunch in an amazing setting &#8211; up the\u00a0 hills with a\u00a0panoramic view of Ban Khoang valley.<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">After arriving to Xuan&#8217;s village and getting some rest you will have dinner with her family- the food was amazing!<\/div><div dir=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/div><h1 dir=\"auto\">Day 2 (12km)<\/h1><div dir=\"auto\">Rise and shine!

<p>Embarking on a journey to Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world, is an experience of a lifetime. Nestled in the heart of Cambodia, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a testament to the grandeur of the Khmer Empire that once ruled these lands. And what better way to explore this ancient city than by cycling Angkor Wat? This article will guide you through our adventure, providing tips and insights to help you plan your own.</p>
<h2>The Journey Begings</h2>
<p>Our adventure began in Siem Reap, a city that serves as the gateway to the Angkor region. After a long journey from Thailand, we were ready to explore the wonders of Angkor Park. The anticipation was high, and we were a bit apprehensive that the experience might not live up to our expectations. But as we soon discovered, Angkor Wat is a must-visit for every true traveler. If you&#8217;re a temple enthusiast, you&#8217;ll simply fall in love with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-563 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rafa in Angkor Wat" width="392" height="588" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-200x300.jpg 200w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Getting there</strong></h2>
<p>Reaching Angkor Park from Siem Reap is straightforward. You can either fly directly to Siem Reap or <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/crossing-the-cambodian-border/">cross the Thai-Cambodian border</a> if you&#8217;re coming from Thailand, like we did. Alternatively, you can also travel from Vietnam. Once in Siem Reap, the journey to Angkor Park is a short one, with the distance being about 7 km.</p>
<h2><strong>How much is it?</strong></h2>
<p>Siem Reap is an affordable city, with meals costing around $3. Accommodation is also reasonably priced. We stayed at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/kh/velkommen-boutique-villa.es.html?aid=304142&amp;group_adults=1&amp;label=gen173nr-1BCAsoeEIYdmVsa29tbWVuLWJvdXRpcXVlLXZpbGxhSDNYBGhGiAEBmAEKuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEBiAIBqAIDuAK7052kBsACAdICJDhhMzIwNDZiLWM0MjQtNDJjMy05OGQwLTUxYzZhNjRlZTgzY9gCBeACAQ-Share-C4h0xWo%401686596043&amp;no_rooms=1">Villa D Riverside Boutique Hotel</a>, which cost around $10 per night. The guesthouse was top-notch, with great staff, cleanliness, and a small swimming pool. It also provided bikes, which we used for our adventure.</p>
<p>However, the entry to Angkor Park is quite pricey. You have three options: a one-day pass for $37, a three-day pass for $62, or a seven-day pass for $72. We opted for the three-day pass, which was sufficient for our exploration.</p>
<h2>Cycling Angkor Wat: The Adventure</h2>
<p>Most visitors hire a Tuk Tuk to explore the park. But we decided that cycling Angkor Wat was the way to go, at least for the first day. It allowed us to be active and truly immerse ourselves in the experience. However, be prepared for the heat. Angkor is a hot place, so it&#8217;s best to start the day very early and retire early.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-542 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04921.jpg" alt="Cycling around Angkor Wat" width="3500" height="2800" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04921.jpg 3500w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04921-300x240.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04921-768x614.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04921-1024x819.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3500px) 100vw, 3500px" /></p>
<h2>Our First Day: The Big Circuit</h2>
<p>Our first day was dedicated to the big circuit. The alarm rang at 4:30 AM. Equipped with our lanterns, we cycled to Angkor Park. The anticipation was high as we pedaled through the quiet streets of Siem Reap, the cool morning air providing a refreshing start to our adventure.</p>
<p>We passed by Angkor Wat, which was already bustling with tourists waiting for the sunrise. However, we decided to stick to our plan and cycled a bit more. Ten minutes later, we arrived at Bayon, one of the biggest temples in the park. We were just in time for the sunrise, and it was well worth it. We had the temple just for ourselves, sharing the serene atmosphere only with a dog and a monk on his early walk.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-551 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1.jpg" alt="Angkor Wat sunrise" width="2200" height="1467" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1.jpg 2200w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04828-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2200px) 100vw, 2200px" /></p>
<p>From Bayon, we embarked on the big circuit. This route covers many temples, including Preah Khan, Neak Pean, and Ta Som. Each temple had its own unique charm, from the intricate carvings of Preah Khan to the serene waters surrounding Neak Pean. Ta Som, with its iconic tree growing out of the eastern entrance, was a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Cycling around Angkor Park was more exhausting than we had anticipated. The heat, combined with the distance, made it a challenging endeavor. But the sense of discovery and the beauty of the temples made it all worthwhile. By 1 PM, we were a bit templed out and decided to call it a day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-548 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3.jpg" alt="Temples" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3.jpg 3000w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Angkor-Wat-6-small-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<p>The ride back home was rewarding. We were greeted by a family of monkeys on the road, a delightful end to our adventure. Despite the exhaustion, the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. We had cycled around Angkor Park, exploring its ancient temples and immersing ourselves in its rich history.</p>
<p>Time to come back to the hotel and hit the pool!</p>
<h2>Our Second Day: The Small Circuit</h2>
<p>After the exertion of the previous day, we decided to give our legs a rest and hired a TukTuk for our second day of exploration. Our driver, Dada, was a friendly local who helped us plan our day and shared interesting insights about the temples and the local culture.</p>
<p>We started our day with a visit to Angkor Wat. Even though we didn&#8217;t catch the sunrise, the temple was still a sight to behold in the early morning light. We spent a good two hours exploring the temple, marveling at its intricate carvings and grand architecture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-561 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2.jpg" alt="A monk in Angkor Wat" width="2734" height="1864" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2.jpg 2734w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-300x205.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-768x524.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC04929-2-1024x698.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2734px) 100vw, 2734px" /></p>
<p>Next, Dada took us to Banteay Samre, a temple located deep in the countryside. The journey to the temple was an adventure in itself. We passed through rural landscapes, witnessing the simple life of Cambodian families living in the countryside. Along the way, we stopped to learn about palm oil production and even got to taste some sweets made from it.</p>
<p>After our visit to Banteay Samre, we returned to our hotel for a well-deserved lunch and a short nap. Refreshed and recharged, we set off in the afternoon to continue our exploration of the small circuit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-541 size-full aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146.jpg" alt="Tomb Raider" width="1795" height="1346" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146.jpg 1795w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-768x576.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GOPR3146-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1795px) 100vw, 1795px" /></p>
<p>The highlight of the afternoon was our visit to Ta Prohm, also known as the &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; temple. With its overgrown trees and moss-covered stones, Ta Prohm had a unique charm that made us feel like we were on an adventure movie set.</p>
<p>We ended the day trying to catch the sunset at Phnom Bakheng, a popular viewpoint. However, due to the limit on the number of visitors, we couldn&#8217;t make it to the top. Instead, we enjoyed a peaceful sunset at Angkor Wat, which was less crowded and offered beautiful photo opportunities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our second day of cycling Angkor Wat was a blend of adventure, culture, and history. Despite the heat and exhaustion, the beauty of the temples and the charm of the countryside made it a day to remember. Whether you choose to cycle or hire a TukTuk, exploring the small circuit of Angkor Wat is an experience you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

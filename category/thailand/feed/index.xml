										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand?</h2>
<p>Despite the competion being fierce, we do think there are strong arguments to believe that Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand. Koh Chang is part of a small archipielago of 3 islands: Koh Chang, Koh Mak and Koh Hut, located in Trat&#8217;s province, south-east of Thailand.</p>
<h3><strong>How to get there</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately there&#8217;s no airport in Koh Chang, making it a bit tricky to get there. Your options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plane + taxi + ferry</strong>: Fly to Trat&#8217;s airport from Bangkok. Then take a taxi to the Ao Thammachat&#8217;s port, where you can reach Koh Chang by sea in 30 minutes. The boat price is 100 Bahts.</li>
<li><strong>Bus + ferry</strong>: Departing from Ekkamai&#8217;s bug station in Bangkok, there are 2 buses (Transport Co. Ltd) departing at 07:45 and 9:00. The trip takes around 6 hours and you get a yummy snack. Then just take the boat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you make it to Koh Chang, you can share a taxi with more people from the boat to make it to your hotel.</p>
<h3><strong>How to move around</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">Koh Chang is not a small island. From south to east it can easily take you one and a half hours. Your options to move around are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Taxis:</strong> The price depends on where you’re going but keep in mind they’re generally pricey.</li>
<li><strong>Renting a motorbike: </strong>The best and cheapest option if you know how to drive. Getting lost in Koh Chang driving a motorbike is one of our favourites memories from our trips around the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What to do</strong></h3>
<p>One of the things why Koh Chang is the best island in Thailand is, of course, the beaches. However, you should know Koh Chang is one of those places where you don&#8217;t really need to worry about what to do. Just ride a motorbike and GET LOST.</p>
<h4><strong>Klong Koi Beach</strong></h4>
<p>Paradise. The sand is amazing and the water is surprisingly warm. I could type here some fancy words trying to describe how good the beach is, but it wouldn&#8217;t make it justice, so just go and judge by youserlf. On your way, visit Bang Bao pier, where you can have a smoothie and do some shopping in the shops in the pier.</p>

<h4><strong>Lonely Beach</strong></h4>
<p>The beach in Lonely Beach is nothing special so you can avoid that. However, Lonely Beach is great to enjoy the food or have some drinks. The atmosphere is very chilled during the day, although in the night it can get a bit crazy as there are some parties going on.</p>
<p>Lonely beach is a great spot to enjoy sunrises. We enjoyed an awesome one in <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/warapura-resort-ko-chang.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Warapura resort</a></strong>. They have happy hours going on in the early evening, which makes it the perfect spot to see the sunset. I wanna be back so bad!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang-sunset-e1582292527691.jpg" alt="koh chang sunset" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<h4><strong>White sand, Khlong Prao and Kai Bae beaches</strong></h4>
<p>You can visit all these in the same day. The first 2 are a bit touristic for our state (plus restaurants are definitely not cheap!) but in Kai Bae we had the beach for ourselves and we had a great time.</p>
<h4><strong>Kholong Phlu waterfall</strong></h4>
<p>If you get tired of beaches, you can go to Khlong Phlu, where you can have a nice short trek and enjoy the time sunbathing in a waterfall. You can dive in if you don&#8217;t mind the mind the company of the small-medium fishes!</p>
<p>All these spots are on the west side of the coast. We drove to the east side but it was definitely less worth it and we ended up turning our way around as there was pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>You can also go to Koh Mak and Koh Kut, the other islands. We&#8217;ve heard great things about them but they are a bit far so if you go, make sure you get some accommodation to spend the night and make the most of them.</p>
<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<h4><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Little Eden Bungalows</a></strong></h4>
<p class="p1">Perfect for budget travelers. Located in Lonely Beach, there are about 10 small bungalows. I would recommend it for backpackers or couples looking to stay somewhere comfortable but authentic at the same time. They have a restaurant where the food is pretty good as well. They also rent motorbikes for a good price (300 bahts).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/th/little-eden-bungalows.html?aid=1530608&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-187 size-large" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1024x900.jpg" alt="little eden" width="640" height="563" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1024x900.jpg 1024w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-300x264.jpg 300w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-768x675.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-1536x1349.jpg 1536w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/koh-chang15-e1582293916267-2048x1799.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/santhiya.en.html?aid=1593090&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2">Santhiya Tree Koh Chang Resort</a></h4>
<p>If you want to relax this is your place. Excellent location, amazing pool and in general great commodities. Live music, delicious breakfast, great sunsets, etc. An outstanding resort.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/santhiya.en.html?aid=1593090&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2"><img decoding="async" class="size-full aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/162/162915342.jpg" width="1280" height="853" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re reading this you&#8217;re probably planning your trip around Thailand and more specifically to beautiful Koh Samui. On this post, we explain how to get to Bangkok from Koh Samui. Also, if you are interested in the other way around, Koh Samui to Bangkok, the same rules and options apply. These are the 4 options:</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8801912-10639348"><strong>Flight to Bangkok from Koh Samui</strong></a></h2>
<p>The most comfortable way but only for those travelling on a deep budget. Bangkok Airways runs this route many times during the day at around 130$ one way. The flight is 1hour 15 minutes and Bangkok Airways is spot on, including their tasty snack. Book here in <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8801912-10639348">SkyScanner</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Bus</strong></a></h2>
<p>This option will take you to Bangkok in 12-13 hours depending on the starting port and the company. We have NOT done it but we&#8217;ve heard some opinions. It&#8217;s not <em>too</em> bad but keeps in mind you will be on a boat for a long time and then a long run in a bus will be waiting for you. Not much fun, especially on choppy days.</p>
<p>The price is around 1200฿-1400฿ (38-44$). <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Van + Train</strong></a></h2>
<p>A bit more comfortable but very long, around 18 hours. A ferry will take you to the mainland and then by van, you will get to Suratthani train station. Then you need to take a train to Bangkok. The train goes from 18:37 to 06:30 so you can get some good sleep in the night.</p>
<p>The price goes from 2289฿ for a train first class ticket (72$) or 1758฿ for a second class ticket (55$). <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Ferry + Van + Flight</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our favourite, since it is good value on money, comfort and time. You could do the whole trip in around 6 hours depending on how long you need to wait for your flight. You&#8217;ll be taken from <strong>Na Thon </strong>port to mainland in a ferry run by <em>Seatran Ferry</em>. The ride is actually nice, safe boat and it has a bar where you can get some instant soups at a good price. After an hour and a half, you get to the mainland, where a van is waiting for you to take you to the airport. Once there you just need to take a flight to Bangkok.</p>
<p>There are very economics flights provided by Thai Smile (great) or Thai Lion (just ok). The price for the boat+van goes from 230฿ for the very early boats to 400฿, plus 30-40$ for the flight. In total, you will get spend around 40-50$, almost as cheap as the Ferry + Bus option but way more comfortable and fast. <a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/koh-samui/bangkok/?z=1511837"><strong>Book here</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The last tip</strong>: make sure you find a proper way to get to the port. We used an app called NavigoApp (Uber/Grab style) because we were told it was way cheaper than normal taxis in Koh Samui. We paid 550฿ from Lamai Beach to Na Thon. However, some fellow travellers did the same trip using a regular taxi for 350฿. I think they just got lucky with the taxi driver, but overall our experience with NavigoApp was awful as the app barely work.</p>
<p>Happy travelling!</p>

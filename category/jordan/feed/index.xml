<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-essential-tips-for-traveling-in-jordan">Essential Tips for Traveling in Jordan</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong>: Jordan can be expensive for tourists, but local eateries offer affordable and delicious meals. Be prepared for higher prices in tourist areas, attractions, and accommodation.</li>



<li><strong>Road Safety</strong>: Jordan&#8217;s roads are safe, but watch for speed limits and police checks (make sure you&#8217;re kind to them and you&#8217;ll be fine!), especially in Amman. The roads can be repetitive but are overall manageable.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Respect local customs, especially on public beaches and religious sites. Dress modestly, and remember the cultural context, even though Jordanians are generally relaxed with tourists.</li>



<li><strong>Jordan Pass</strong>: This pass, although seemingly expensive, offers savings on attractions. No brainer really, buy it.</li>



<li><strong>Alcohol</strong>: Limit alcohol consumption to none, as Jordan is a Muslim country, and alcohol is hardly available. Jordan is not the right destination for alcohol!</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-1-arrival-and-the-dead-sea-s-tranquility">Day 1 of Jordan Itinerary: Dead Sea&#8217;s Tranquility</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3525" srcset="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-300x169.webp 300w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-768x432.webp 768w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rafa-dead-sea-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Upon landing in Amman, your 1 Week Jordan Itinerary adventure begins. Depending on your arrival time, you may choose to rest in the capital or embark on a drive to the Dead Sea. If is the latter &#8211; our recommendation-, <a href="https://www.booking.com/Share-aBV5J5" target="_new" rel="noopener">Mujib Chalets</a> awaits you, offering affordable bungalows with direct access to an untouched beach. Worth pointing out that there aren&#8217;t that many accommodations in the Dead Sea, and they&#8217;re normally the all-included &#8216;resort&#8217; type, which isn&#8217;t our cup of tea. With Mujib Chalets, however, you have simple but beautiful bungalows, with access to a private beach where you can float in the mineral-rich waters, indulge in local cuisine, and soak in breathtaking views. The chalets&#8217; proximity to Wadi Mujib makes them an ideal base for the next day&#8217;s adventure. The authentic and virgin beach experience, combined with top-notch food and views, sets the tone for an extraordinary journey.</p>



<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/Share-aBV5J5" target="_new" rel="noopener">Mujib Chalets</a></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-2-adventure-in-wadi-mujib">Day 2: Adventure in Wadi Mujib</h3>



<p>Wadi Mujib, known as the Grand Canyon of Jordan, offers an amazing adventure navigating water passages in nature&#8217;s wonder. Make sure to rent special shoes, which you can do at the door or at the hotel. Entry to Wadi Mujib costs JD 21 (approx. €26 or $29), and keep in mind the experience can be physically demanding but it is 100% rewarding. Afterward, explore the Dead Sea&#8217;s landscapes from above, capturing stunning photographs, or return to the comfort of your chalet for more Dead Sea relaxation.</p>



<p><strong>We really think Wadi Mujib is an underrated experience. For us, it was without a doubt THE highlight of our 1 Week Jordan Itinerary!</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: Wadi Mujib opens from April to October, so accommodate the itinerary if you will be visiting outside these months!</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-3-4-petra-s-ancient-wonders">Day 3-4: Petra&#8217;s Ancient Wonders</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3534" srcset="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The journey to Wadi Musa, home to Petra, unveils unique landscapes and glimpses of camels. Spend two enriching days exploring Petra&#8217;s iconic sites like the Treasury or the Monastery. Consider hiring a local guide for storytelling and insights, as otherwise after a while it can feel a bit like &#8216;visiting rocks&#8217;. Rest at the Petra Sky Hotel, a budget-friendly option with a terrace perfect for sunset views. Avoid Petra by Night, often considered a tourist trap, and instead explore Wadi Musa&#8217;s tranquil ambiance and delicious food options. Two days allow for a leisurely exploration, providing time to understand Petra better and enjoy the town&#8217;s calm and pleasant atmosphere.</p>



<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/Share-ilMvYF" target="_new" rel="noopener">Petra Sky Hotel</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3533" width="823" height="548" srcset="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-300x200.webp 300w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-768x512.webp 768w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/petra1-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-5-aqaba-s-coastal-charm">Day 5: Aqaba&#8217;s Coastal Charm</h3>



<p>Aqaba, a coastal city less frequented by tourists, offers a blend of local culture and beachside relaxation. Enjoy snorkeling or diving at Berenice Beach Club (a day pass gives you access to facilities and tours) or explore public beaches (keep cultural mindfulness). In the evening, the lively Souq beckons with shopping, dining, and authentic local interactions. Aqaba&#8217;s blend of tradition and modernity provides a refreshing contrast to the historical sites visited earlier. The city&#8217;s full-of-life nature and safety make it a delightful place to explore and enjoy.</p>



<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/Share-mHseFqB" target="_new" rel="noopener">Taj Hotel</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-6-desert-dreams-in-wadi-rum">Day 6: Desert Dreams in Wadi Rum</h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3535" srcset="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Wadi Rum, the desert&#8217;s heart, offers an experience that transcends the ordinary. Choosing a tour can be challenging, as they all look the same with similar prices. Our recommendation is to go with <a href="https://www.wadirumstillness.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener">Wadi Rum Stillness</a> for a tour that includes sleeping under the stars, guided by Bedouin locals who share stories and cook traditional meals. The option to sleep in the open, under a high rock, adds to the uniqueness of the experience. Wake to a desert sunrise and capture memories through photographs that will last a lifetime <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. The connection with local guides and the opportunity to understand their culture adds depth to this unforgettable desert experience, a highlight of our 1 Week Jordan Itinerary.</p>



<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: <a href="https://www.wadirumstillness.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener">Wadi Rum Stillness</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3536" srcset="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wadi-rum-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-day-7-amman-s-cultural-tapestry">Day 7: Amman&#8217;s Cultural Wonder</h3>



<p>Return to Amman and dive into the city&#8217;s bustling life. Explore historical sites like the Amman Citadel, Roman Theater, and King Abdullah Mosque. That&#8217;s all great, but our 100% recommendation is this: join a free walking tour with <a href="https://www.guruwalk.com/es/walks/37864-free-walking-tour-amman-historia-cultura-y-comida" target="_new" rel="noopener">Mujalli</a> for a blend of touristic and local experiences, including markets, mosques, and bars. This was another of our Jordan&#8217;s highlights since it allowed us to know Jordan and its locals from a completely different perspective. Totally recommend it, do not hesitate!</p>



<p>Next day, consider a day trip to Gerasa (Jerash) if time permits, or continue to explore Amman&#8217;s hidden gems. The city&#8217;s mix of history, culture, and modernity offers a fitting conclusion to a week of exploration.</p>



<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/Share-1hlExJ" target="_new" rel="noopener">The Castle Star</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Updated June 2023:</strong> This post has been updated to reflect the current information and tips for your 3 week Vietnam itinerary. Enjoy planning your adventure!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Planning a trip to Vietnam is an adventure filled with excitement. However, with Vietnam&#8217;s vast landscapes and rich culture, it can be challenging to decide how long to spend in each place to truly experience its charm. <strong>The good news for you is that we&#8217;re here to help you organise your 3 week&nbsp;Vietnam itinerary.</strong></p>
<p>With our guide, you&#8217;ll go from north to south, but you could start in the south if it works best for you, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. Worth mentioning, we take our time when visiting places, as we don&#8217;t like visiting places just to put a tick on it.</p>
<h2>How much money do I need?</h2>
<p>The currency is the Vietnamese Dong. You&#8217;ll get about 23,000 Dongs for a Dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 USD = 23,000 VND</p>
<p>Vietnam is a very cheap country, but it can also become expensive if you aren&#8217;t careful. Budget accommodations range between 15$ to 30$ per night, while food ranges between 2$ and 7$. If you really take good care of your money, you can allocate a 30$ budget per day. A 50$ per day budget will make a great holiday though.</p>
<ul>
<li>15$ &#8211; 30$ per night</li>
<li>2$ &#8211; 7$</li>
<li>~1$</li>
<li>TOTAL: 30$ per day</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Visa</span></h2>
<p>A very important thing to double-check. Vietnam is more restrictive than other countries in South East Asia. Many nationalities get a 15 days visa on arrival, but others will need to apply for it before landing in Vietnam.</p>
<p>If for example, you want to follow our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a visa.&nbsp;You can do it online, taking 3 days and costing you 30$.&nbsp;If you didn&#8217;t do your homework and you&#8217;re short on time, there are some companies who will make a visa for you in even 15 minutes, but prepare the wallet&#8230;</p>
<h2>3 week Vietnam Itinerary</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hanoi-5.png" alt="Vietnam map" width="735" height="1102"></p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" data-elementor-setting-key="title" data-pen-placeholder="Type Here...">Hanoi &#8211; 3 nights</h2>
<p>Hanoi, the vibrant capital of Vietnam, is the first stop on our 3-week Vietnam itinerary. While it&#8217;s possible to explore the city&#8217;s highlights in 2 days, taking it easy can offer a deeper appreciation of Hanoi&#8217;s bustling life.</p>
<p>The capital of Vietnam is one of the most lively cities we&#8217;ve ever been to. People just pass their day sitting on the street and sipping (amazing!) coffee. You will see the worst traffic you&#8217;ve ever witnessed, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. Hanoi is a beautiful city full of lovely quarters, things to do and new food to experience.</p>
<p>For a detailed guide to Hanoi &#8211; check our&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/hanoi-travel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07840-730x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi temple" width="296" height="415"></p>
<ul>
<li>Roam around Hoan Kiem lake. Visit Ngoc Son, a small temple situated in the middle of the lake.</li>
<li>Wander around the Old and French Quarters.</li>
<li>Visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. It&#8217;s incredible how much respect North-Vietnamese&#8217;s have for their old leader.</li>
<li>Visit Hoa Lo prison, colloquially known as &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;.</li>
<li>See the train passing on the&nbsp; famous <b>&#8220;Train Street&#8221;</b></li>
<li>We did a free food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">Hanoi Free Walking Tours</a> and it was amazing. The guides are students and they will take you to places that you would not go on your own. Great way to get you started with Vietnamese food.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07660-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Delicious Pho!" width="640" height="360"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other things you could do&#8230;</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Don Xuan Market. You can find pretty much anything here.</li>
<li>Museum of Anthropology, especially interesting if you&#8217;re into finding out about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam.</li>
<li>Water puppet theatre.</li>
<li>Opera house.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TIP:&nbsp;</strong>If you get to Hanoi via plane, don&#8217;t take a creepy taxi to go to the city centre. Download GRAB. It cost us 10$ to go to the city centre, 3 times cheaper than the price the taxi drivers offer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07859-2-792x1024.jpg" alt="Hanoi street" width="364" height="471"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>
<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/old-quarter-view-hanoi-hostel.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAso9AFCHW9sZC1xdWFydGVyLXZpZXctaGFub2ktaG9zdGVsSDNYBGhGiAEBmAEJuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEB-AECiAIBqAIDuAKGjs6jBsACAdICJDYxOGU2ZGU1LWJlZWEtNGI2Ni1iOTc3LTU4YTRjNGQ1YWI4MtgCBeACAQ&amp;sid=143ebf34424666d04af1f22761d460d9&amp;dist=0&amp;group_adults=1&amp;keep_landing=1&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;type=total&amp;">Old Quarter View Hanoi Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Located in the heart of the Old Quarter, it is the perfect hostel for backpackers. Comfort and value at the same time, it has options for under 10$ a night, breakfast included.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en-gb.html"><strong>Hanoi La Selva</strong></a></p>
<p>Great facilities and lovely staff at a very reasonable price. Gorgeous rooms and located in the Old Quarter, next to Hoan Kiem Lake.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/828/82825620.jpg" alt="Hanoi La Selva" width="1280" height="853"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Sapa -2 nights</span></h2>
<p>The landscapes of the very north of Vietnam are a must-see and you shouldn&#8217;t miss them. The easiest place to visit is Sapa, this comes at a cost though. We&#8217;ve heard Sapa can be very touristic and a bit fake. However, if you&#8217;re clever and book the right trekking, your experience will have nothing to do with that.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can avoid paying for one night of accommodation by taking <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">this</a></strong> very comfortable night bus.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa-1024x815.jpg" alt="Hill Tribes of Sapa" width="640" height="509"></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Trekking</span></h3>
<p>We booked a trek called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; with <a href="http://sapaochau.org/">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a>&nbsp;and it was one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had when travelling. More about this&nbsp;<a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/trekking-and-homestay-with-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>
<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://sapaochau.org/contact-us/booking/">Sapa O’Chau</a></strong></p>
<p>Sapa O&#8217;Chau is also a humble hotel. You can stay here the night before/after your trekking. The rooms are clean and quite cheap, so it has good value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/eco-palms-house-sapa"><b>Eco Palms House Retreat</b></a></p>
<p>For those looking for an eco-retreat. Bungalows in the middle of rice fields with amazing views of the mountain. You can also appreciate the views while sipping wine in a bathtub.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/206/206506622.jpg" alt="Eco Palms Retreat" width="1280" height="622"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ha Long Bay &#8211; 1 or 2 nights</span></h2>
<p>Our 3 week Vietnam itinerary would not be complete without a visit to Ha Long Bay, one of the highlights of every visitor to Vietnam. A boat cruise will take you around the Bay for 1 or 2 nights, depending on how long you choose to stay. We&#8217;re budget travellers, so we chose 1 night. Most of the companies will include transportation from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay in the price.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">this post</a> about how to choose between Sapa or Ha Long Bay in case you&#8217;re short on time or budget.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Boats usually spend the night in Ha Long Bay, meaning you end up sharing the night with hundreds of boats. Some cruises take a slightly different route, sleeping in Bai Tu Long Bay. This will make your experience MUCH BETTER. Our sunset was unforgettable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08352-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa in Ha Long Bay cruise" width="640" height="360"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Our choice</span></h3>
<p>We took the package called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; offered by <a href="https://www.indochina-junk.com/">Indochina Junk</a>. With this option, you&#8217;ll spend the night in Bai Tu Long Bay.</p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ninh Binh -2 nights</span></h2>
<p>We got to Ninh Binh via train from Hanoi. We had a great time biking around Tam Coc, although we were a bit unlucky as we had heavy rain for one day, meaning we couldn&#8217;t make it to the national park. Still, we had an amazing time in this beautiful countryside area.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08760-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Lake" width="640" height="360"></p>
<ul>
<li>Tam Coc Lake tour. One hour stroll in a small boat. The landscape is very similar to Ha Long Bay but it is still worth it.</li>
<li>Bich Dong Pagoda</li>
<li>Bird Valley</li>
<li>Mua cave. The cave is the least important thing, make sure you hike the mountain to get the perfect views!</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08935-2-819x1024.jpg" alt="Iga in Ninh Binh" width="365" height="457"></p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Rent a bike (most hostels provide very cheap bikes) and cycle everywhere. The roads are very safe and the views deserve to be appreciated. You won&#8217;t get the same experience using Tuk Tuks or motorbikes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08577-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rafa cycling in Ninh Binh" width="640" height="360"></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08480-1024x576.jpg" alt="Tam Coc's pagoda" width="640" height="360"></h3>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>
<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-horizon-bungalow.en.html?aid=1595697&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</a></strong></p>
<p>Outstanding bungalows surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible. Probably the best place to stay in Ninh Binh.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/135/135926283.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow" width="1200" height="900"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hue &#8211; 1 night</span></h2>
<p>We got to Hue by night bus from Ninh Binh. Be aware the bus wasn&#8217;t particularly safe, nothing to do with the one we took to go to Sapa.</p>
<p>Hue is the city of the Citadel. While the Citadel is impressive and very interesting from a historical point of view, if we had to cut down one day from our itinerary it would be Hue. Still, we had a nice day and enjoyed the city. During the night there is a nice market by the river and many nice options for dinner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09004-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hue Temple" width="640" height="360"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hue Citadel and Forbidden City</li>
<li>Walk stroll next to the river. There are many markets and restaurants</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>
<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/bonjour-hostel.en.html?aid=1595705&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Bonjour Hostel</a></strong></p>
<p>Well located, very clean and offers rooms under 10$ the night depending on the dates. Delicious breakfast included! Just has tremendous value.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-scarlett-boutique.en.html?aid=1595714&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very affordable luxury rooms (about 50$ the night). One of the most visited and prestigious hotels in Hue, you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/806/80608521.jpg" alt="The Scarlett Boutique Hotel" width="1280" height="853"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Hoi An -6 nights</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09214-819x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An temple" width="435" height="545"></p>
<p>Continuing our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, we&#8217;ll get to Hoi An. To get to this gem town, we strongly recommend the train if you come from Hue. It goes next to the Hai Van Pass, a 21 km mountain pass with beautiful views of the sea.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Hoi An is our favourite city in Vietnam. With its pristine beaches, lush rice fields, and a beautiful old town illuminated by lanterns, Hoi An offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage that we found truly captivating.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>An Bang beach. Relaxing beach with very good and tasty restaurants. Also, you can do parasailing for 30$ 2 people. We did it and was AMAZING.</li>
<li>The old town at night. Have a stroll in the old town at night, when all the lanterns are on. Simply beautiful.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09473-e1540057985468.jpg" alt="Hoi An at night" width="478" height="382"></p>
<ul>
<li>No better city to buy souvenirs. We bought a few too many lanterns (but we don&#8217;t regret it!).</li>
<li>Ride a motorbike around Hoi An. We&#8217;ll never forget the joy of riding the motorbike from the city centre to the beach, passing next to the rice fields.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09455-1024x819.jpg" alt="Hoi An lights" width="560" height="448"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other things you could do</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ancient town tour. Old houses, museums, Japanese covered bridge, etc.</li>
<li>Marble Mountains, halfway between Da Nang and Hoi An.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Motorbike is a must in Hoi An. The roads are good and traffic is more &#8220;western&#8221; than in other places of the country. Another plus: you won&#8217;t have to deal with tuk-tuk or taxi drivers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09167-672x1024.jpg" alt="Hoi An river" width="431" height="656"></p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;">Where to stay</h3>
<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/melody-boutique-villa-hoi-an">Melody Boutique Villa Hoi An</a></strong></p>
<p>Modern construction, clean, fresh and very comfortable. The staff is amazing and will help you with anything you need. Bicycles and scooters are available for rental at very affordable prices. Amazing value (rooms under 15$ the night).</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/little-town-villa">Little Town Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>Luxury but an affordable villa in the old town. Spacious rooms and tasteful decoration. The breakfast is great, with both local and international options. Swimming pool to cool down after a long walk around the old town.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://r-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/914/91422260.jpg" alt="Little Town Villa" width="1280" height="853"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Da Lat -3 nights</span></h2>
<p>As we continue our 3-week Vietnam itinerary, it&#8217;s time for an exhilarating adventure! Da Lat, renowned for its rolling hills, verdant forests, and stunning waterfalls, is an unmissable destination for nature lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Must do things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapelling waterfalls</li>
<li>Visiting Pongour Falls</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>
<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/giaphamhotel">Gia Pham Hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Very comfortable private room for under 8$ per night. Value doesn&#8217;t get better than this. Extremely helpful staff and a very good location.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/villa-doc-may">Doc May Boutique Villa</a></strong></p>
<p>A little boutique place at an exceptional price. The villa location is great and you can walk or cycle pretty much anywhere, including the night market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/138/138005574.jpg" alt="Doc May Boutique Villa" width="552" height="415"></p>
<h2 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ho Chi Minh -2 nights</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC07769-1024x711.jpg" alt="Ho Chi Minh's market" width="640" height="444"></p>
<p>The last stop of our 3 week Vietnam itinerary is Ho Chi Minh, also known as Saigon. We stayed 2 nights but 1 night-2 days works well too.</p>
<p>The capital of what it was &#8220;South Vietnam&#8221;, it is as vibrant or more than Hanoi. Also, it is a great city to learn more about Vietnam&#8217;s war with the Americans.</p>
<h3 style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Walk around District 1.</li>
<li>Memorial war museum.</li>
<li><a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/">Cu Chi Tunnels</a>.</li>

<h2>Other places you could visit</h2>
<ul>
<li style="color: #7a7a7a;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ha Giang</strong>. Not including this one in our 3 week Vietnam itinerary really hurt. This province is in the North of Vietnam, next to the Chinese border. This is a less touristic alternative to Sapa. Unfortunately, you should do it only if you have around 4-5 days, as it is very remote and takes some time to get there.</span></li>

				<p><i>Updated April 2023: Uncover the charm of northern Vietnam! Dive into our comprehensive guide to help you decide: Ha Long Bay or Sapa? Explore breathtaking landscapes and authentic experiences.</i></p><p>Are you planning a trip to the north of Vietnam and find yourself torn between visiting the enchanting Ha Long Bay or the captivating Sapa? You&#8217;re not alone. This is a common dilemma faced by many travelers due to the unique attractions each destination offers. But worry not, we&#8217;ve got you covered. We&#8217;ve explored both places and are here to help you make an informed decision.</p><p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: 'Nothing You Could Do'; font-size: 40px; font-weight: 900;">Price Considerations</span></p><p>When deciding between Ha Long Bay or Sapa, it&#8217;s essential to consider your budget. Both destinations offer a variety of packages, but generally, Ha Long Bay tends to be a more expensive experience.</p><p>For Sapa, prices range from $40 to $75 for a 1-night and 2-day trek, including a homestay in a village. The group size usually ranges from 2 to 6 people. For the same price, you can only manage day-trips to Ha Long Bay. A 1-night and 2-day experience in Ha Long Bay will cost around $80 to $250, depending on the cruise you choose.</p><p><strong>What we picked:</strong> For Sapa, we chose <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O’Chau</a> </strong>and loved it. They promote  sustainable employment among the locals which is a plus for us. We chose the tour called “Off the beaten track” as we don’t like touristic activities and we paid 60$ each.</p><p> </p><p>Ha Long Bay is one of the “you get what you pay for” places. If you get a cheap one, you may end up in an awful boat with awful food, wishing the cruise finishes as soon as possible. Thus, we went <em>really </em>out of our budget and chose the package also called &#8216;Off the Beaten Track&#8217; offered by <a href="https://www.indochina-junk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indochina Junk</a> for 149$ per person. Important to note that most of the cruises sleep in Ha Long Bay, along with thousands of boats. Choosing that package we wanted to avoid the crowds- our cruise spent the night on Bai Tu Long Bay with only a few boats on the horizon. The boat was pretty good and included a very comfortable transportation from Hanoi. <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );"> </span></p><p></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/indochina-junk.png" alt="Ha Long Bay or Sapa?" width="859" height="552" /></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Price: easy win for Sapa</strong><strong> </strong></h4><h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2><p>Your expectations and what you&#8217;re looking for in your travel experience are crucial factors when choosing between Ha Long Bay or Sapa.</p><p>Sapa was one of the highlights of our trips. Our guide and homestay were simply incredible. We learned so much about her village and tribe, the landscape was breathtaking, and the food was authentic. Most importantly, we didn’t see a single tourist for 2 days. When we left Sapa, we felt like leaving our second home, but we were full of joy thanks to Xuan, our guide. The connection you create with the place and people during these 2 days of trekking is amazing.Apri</p>					</div>

Our boat was beautiful. The food was AMAZING. The activities are alright, but not breathtaking. A couple of hours kayaking and visiting a fisherman village. They also let us swim for 30 minutes in open water, which was nice. We missed being able to swim at some beach but this is forbidden by the government. Obviously, you have no independence as everything is planned.<br /><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );"><br /></span></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dsc08381.jpg" alt="The views were amazing" width="3600" height="2026" /></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Experience: Sapa wins by a little</b><b style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14px;"> </b></h4><h2><strong>Comfort</strong></h2><p>If you&#8217;re going to Sapa, be prepared to trek mountains, sleep in a maybe not very comfortable homestay, get muddy if it rains, etc. For Ha Long Bay, you literally feel like Paris Hilton and you don’t need to move a finger. Just relax and enjoy the cruise!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dsc08358.jpg" alt="Rafa in the boat" width="3600" height="2026" /></p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Comfort: very easy win for Ha Long Bay</strong></h4><p style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>If you have the time and the budget, do BOTH. Especially because both experiences are unique and are so different from each other. However, If we had to choose only one, <strong>we would choose Sapa, </strong>just because we had a really authentic experience, one of those that makes travelling so rewarding.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>What would you choose?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few days before our one month visa in Vietnam expired, we decided to finish our north-to-south trip doing something special: we wanted to spend our last days <strong>Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh.</strong> This would give us the chance to spend some quality time with locals, something that we hadn&#8217;t managed so far for one reason or another.</p>
<p>This is how we found Thao, a girl who quitted her job to open <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SaigonEnglishAdventures/about/">Saigon English Adventures</a></strong>, an English school in Hoh Chi Minh, or better known as Saigon. She offers free accommodation at her place in exchange for volunteering in a few English classes with her students. We aren&#8217;t native speakers but we thought it should be good fun, so we applied. Thao promptly came back approving the stay. We were going to spend a few days interacting with Vietnamese people, exciting times!</p>
<p>She told us she would be away most of our stay as she was on holidays, so her roommate Jane would really be our host. We landed in Saigon from Da Nang at midnight, hopped into a Grab heading to the provided address. Jane picked us up with a huge smile and took us home. We would be sleeping in the living room, that turned out to be also the English school classroom!</p>
<h2>Visiting Saigon</h2>
<p>Next day we woke up early and went out to do some sightseeing. We walked to the city center (also called District 1) to discover a bit of Saigon, a unique city. Crazy traffic with motorbikes everywhere, chickens in the street, motorbike taxi drivers taking naps on their bikes, etc. A huge pink Catholic church caught our attention, as we had never seen one like it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-569 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg" alt="Pink church in Saigon" width="527" height="937" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-169x300.jpg 169w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>After walking a while we got to the War Memorial Museum. There we had another lesson of how sad and unnecessary wars are. For lunch, we got some cheap Pho, you can&#8217;t beat the price! (30 Vietnamese dongs = 1.5$).</p>
<p>From lunch to evening we wandered around the city center, where we found the <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/the-strangest-protest-ever/" data-wplink-url-error="true">strangest protest we have ever witnessed</a>.</p>
<p>Next day we woke up early to visit the Cu Chi tunnels, one of the most popular attractions in Vietnam. If you want to read about this or you want to know how to visit the Cu Chi tunnels on our own, <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/" data-wplink-url-error="true">visit this post.</a> Once back from the tunnels, the most exciting part of the trip was about to start: English classes!</p>
<h2>English classes</h2>
<p>Jane told us the English teacher couldn&#8217;t make it to the class, meaning we had to drive the class with her help. Iga got a bit stressed about it but I was fine with it, I knew it was going to be so much fun!</p>
<p>One by one, the students started arriving. They were more or less on our age, a bit younger maybe. And you can&#8217;t imagine how cute they were! Their English was limited but they could communicate, especially because they were not shy at all, which makes everything much easier. The class ended up being 2 hours of &#8220;Ask me anything&#8221; and it was just so much fun. We also got to know a bit about each of them and we can tell they are beautiful people.</p>
<p>After the class, they invited us for dinner at a very Vietnamese restaurant. They ordered so much traditional food, which we obviously appreciated as sometimes can be daunting to try new food in exotic countries. We drank, laughed, ate, exchanged social media profiles, life experiences&#8230;and that was it! At the end of the night we were so happy with the experience, and also a bit sad because we could not stay any longer with them.</p>
<p>Next day we woke up and met Thao, the Couchsurfing host and the director of the school. We got to chat a bit with her, enough to be inspired by the happiness she emits. After having breakfast, we assisted her with a new English class. This group&#8217;s level was very basic, plus you could tell they weren&#8217;t very used to be with foreign people, so they were a bit shy. Still, it was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Spending the weekend Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh was an amazing experience. It was exactly what we look for when traveling: visiting new places and meeting inspiring people, like Thao, Jane or their students. What about you? What do you look for when traveling?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During our visit to Ho Chi Minh (also called Saigon), we happened to witness the strangest protest ever!</p>
<p>Hundreds of people&nbsp;<strong>riding motorbikes&nbsp;</strong>gathered in the city center (District 1) to protest in front of a government building. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever seen so many flags and motorbikes in such a small space! We found interesting the police&#8217;s behavior; they soon arrived to shut down the protest, but it was clear they were in favor of it. They took their time before forcing riders to move away from the building. After this, they kept riding the city center for quite a while.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">By the looks of it, we could tell was something against immigrants but we didn&#8217;t feel threatened at any moment, meaning it wasn&#8217;t related to tourists. After a while, a&nbsp;very sophisticated Vietnamese man with a very correct English&nbsp;explained&nbsp;to us what was this about. Turns out there is a law in Vietnam that allows foreigners to rent properties for 99 years. Vietnamese feel Chinese are taking advantage of this law and they are occupying big chunks of towns, making them more Chinese than Vietnamese. From what we saw there, Vietnamese are not a fan of their Chinese neighbors, as you could read big banners saying &#8220;Chinese out of Vietnam NOW&#8221; or &#8220;Vietnam for Vietnamese&#8221;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">There is a law in Vietnam that allows foreigners to rent properties for 99 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This topic is creating a lot of tension for the party in charge of the government, the Vietnamese Communist Party (Vietnam is one of the 5 countries to be communist nowadays, along with Laos, China, North Korea and Cuba). They need to expand its economic relationships with China, it&#8217;s neighbor to the north, but at the same time their population feels they&#8217;re selling their country for money.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this interesting topic, this <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152150/dont-give-our-land-away-clash-interests-vietnams-anti">article</a> talks about it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The video shows very well the essence of Vietnam: motorbikes &amp;&nbsp;patriotism.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_tunnels">Cu Chi tunnels</a></strong> on your own is something we recommend everyone to do when <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/couch-surfing-in-ho-chi-minh/" data-wplink-url-error="true">visiting Ho Chi Minh</a>. The Cu Chi tunnels are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels that cover up to 250 km. Using these tunnels you could even get to Cambodia! They played a key role in the war to beat the Americans, who tried to destroy them many times but couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To get there tourists usually hire a group tour but <strong>there is a way to get to the Cu Chi tunnels on your own.</strong> Most importantly, tours take tourists to a less authentic side of the tunnels, whereas going by yourself you get to the side where Vietnamese tourists go. Don&#8217;t worry, you will still get an English speaking guide. Ours was very funny!</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>How to get to the Cu Chi tunnels on your own</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to Pham Ngu Lao bus station.</li>
<li>Take bus number 13 that will take you to Ben Xe Cu Chi (last stop).</li>
<li>Get the bus 79 to Cu Chi tunnels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bus tickets are <strong>7000 Vietnamese dongs</strong> each (0.3$), whereas tickets for the Cu Chi tunnels are <strong>90000 dongs</strong> (4$). English speaking guide included in the price.</p>
<p><strong>Funny fact</strong>: the buses don&#8217;t stop until the end of the journey, so it&#8217;s kind of a challenge to hop on/off the bus. I really felt bad for an old man trying to hop off, Vietnam is not a country for old men.</p>
<h2>The visit</h2>
<p>The visit shows how tough and driven the Vietnamese people were during the war. The tunnels are claustrophobic and crazy small. It&#8217;s incredible the Vietnamese managed to live for so long in a place like this. Everything was very well designed and thought of. They had hospitals, kitchens and leaders meeting rooms inside them. If one tunnel was bombed and compromised, the rest of the tunnels would be fine. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Iga proved to be braver than me and entered in every single tunnel, while I only did it in a few. I&#8217;m going to make up an excuse and say I&#8217;m too tall (I&#8217;m not). There was one tunnel in which you could even hear a bat flying around haha. Nope, I&#8217;m not going in there sir!</p>
<p>At the end of the visit, you can shoot some guns if you&#8217;re into that (we aren&#8217;t). There is also a beautiful temple in honor of the war victims and Ho Chi Minh. We were lucky to see a school trip there, participating in a ceremony in Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s honor, singing and waving Vietnamese flag. Very patriotic, just like Vietnamese are!</p>
<p>If you liked it, share it!</p>

And meeting the Hill Tribes of Sapa was on my bucket list for Vietnam!</p><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">Before going to Sapa, a town in the North of Vietnam, we were warned that it is packed with tourists and locals doing everything to sell you &#8220;handmade&#8221; souvenirs. Which, by the way, proved true. <strong>But if you only dare to go off the beaten track like we did, you will be able to discover the <em>real</em> hill tribes.</strong></div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">Kids walking their buffalo at the dusk, men working in the rice fields. Mothers with their babies waving to you from their homes. Idyllic. All of them wearing traditional clothes &#8211; not for tourists, but because this is how things were since they came to Vietnam from China ages ago.</div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div dir="auto">Get lost and discover the authentic life of Hill Tribes of Sapa, this world will mesmerise you.</div><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto"><p>The price you will pay is sweat, sweat and sweat. Hills are difficult to climb in a summer heat, but that only makes you appreciate the breathtaking views of the rice fields mountains even more.</p><p> </p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-874 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa7.jpg" alt="Sapa rice fields" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa7.jpg 640w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa7-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p></div><div dir="auto"><h1>We met the authentic Hill Tribes of Sapa thanks to Xuan, our guide from the Red Dao tribe</h1><p>Like most girls in the village, she got married when she was very young. In many villages there is a place called &#8220;love market&#8221;, where teenagers are allowed to meet and get to know each other with the permission of their parents. If they fell in love and feel like it is a good match, the boy asks parents to marry their daughter. And her parents accepted.</p><p>In a patriarchal society, the bride always moves in with the groom&#8217;s parents. Imagine you are preparing a lunch for the whole family, and you don&#8217;t know how to pack rice in the banana leaves. I asked: &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you ask your mother how to do that?&#8221;. &#8220;There was no phone in the village, and I had moved far away from my family, so I had to learn by myself&#8221;, she said. And this is pretty much the definition of Xuan &#8211; all she achieved is thanks to herself!</p></div><h1 dir="auto">Every tribe has its own traditional textiles and clothing</h1><div dir="auto">Parents rarely refuse the marriage, if so, it is probably because the boy is from another village or tribe. You would say, &#8220;why does it matter if they live next to each other anyway?&#8221;</div><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-361 alignleft" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dsc08147-731x1024.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="233" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dsc08147-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dsc08147-214x300.jpg 214w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dsc08147-768x1075.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px" /></strong><div dir="auto"><strong>In the Dao culture where worshipping your ancestors is the main religion (shamanism), providing the continuity of tradition is almost an obligation. </strong>On a very rare occasion, the young wife coming from a different tribe will learn it the hard way. Among many things, wife&#8217;s responsibility is to make traditional handmade clothes for the family, and as they vary a lot between tribes, she would be in a pickle.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">Honestly, the level of detail and embroidery is outstanding. <strong>Look at that dress Xuan made herself for her little daughter. It took her over 3 months!</strong></div><div dir="auto"><strong> </strong></div><h1 dir="auto">Shamanism in practice</h1><div dir="auto">For all Hill Tribes of Sapa ancestors blessing is important, it can provide you with a happy life. You have to watch out not to mistreat them (I am talking about <em>ghosts</em>, yes). <b>For example, after finishing your meal in the fields you should never leave banana leaves (with rests from the meal) in a place where buffalo can eat them.</b> You are not wrong, buffalo&#8217;s stomach can take some banana leaves with rice pretty well, however it would mean that ancestors will get full and won&#8217;t &#8220;send&#8221; any food for their family.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">As we passed by a dead snake on our hike, I asked Xuan if there is any animal that they consider particularly important. She said &#8220;buffalo&#8221;. The surprising connection between buffalo getting his stomach full and ancestors not being hungry anymore would most surely confirm that!</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-378 aligncenter" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dsc08160.jpg" alt="DSC08160" width="593" height="396" /></div><div dir="auto"><p>We were able to ask her all sorts of things, as her English is amazingly good,  especially for someone who went only to a primary school because parents could not afford her further education. She is the only person in the whole village that speaks English and she learned it herself by memorizing a new word every day (no Internet in the village FYI!).</p></div><h1 dir="auto">Discovering feminism in Hill Tribes of Sapa</h1></div><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Until now, no one in the village (apart from her husband) comprehends completely what she is doing. Trekking all day in the burning sun with &#8220;Europeans&#8221;? Why would they pay you for that? Some ask her husband: aren&#8217;t you worried that she is out there? She just laughs at that. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">A tender, loving mother and an amazing wife. She believes men and women are equal and she puts it into practice. With everything she does, she trusts herself: &#8220;listen to what people say like it&#8217;s the wind- goes in one ear, goes out another&#8221;.</span></div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">Xuan fascinated me as a woman. She managed to respect the tradition and yet, live her own way.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><strong>As I listened to her one night, I realised that it is what the <em>feminism</em> is all about, ladies. It is easy to refuse everything that culture enforces on you as a woman like we can afford to do nowadays in a western world. Be as independent, manly, strong as we want. What is hard though, is to be the first one that dares to be different in a small, traditional community.</strong></div></div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div dir="auto"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-380 aligncenter" src="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dsc08213.jpg" alt="DSC08213" width="497" height="751" /></div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><div dir="auto">Cheerful, hard-working, grateful, and yet fearless. This is Xuan, a woman that leads the past gently into the future&#8230; wearing sneakers and embroidered Dao trousers.</div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><h1 dir="auto"><strong>How to enjoy Sapa with Xuan</strong></h1><div dir="auto">Xuan May is one of the guides of <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a>. </strong>She does the trekking called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221;, so when booking just you make sure you ask for that trekking with her. To get there, you can do it by <a href="https://12go.asia/en/train/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapatrain"><strong>train</strong></a> or <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">bus.</a> </strong>We got a sleeper bus for a night ride and it was very comfortable (only 10$ per person).</div><div dir="auto"> </div><h1 dir="auto">Day 1 (17km)</h1><div><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-873 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa6.jpg" alt="Sapa" width="640" height="347" /></div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">You will be picked up in Sapa town around 8 am and taken a little bit up the hills in a van. The trekking starts in a small village and you will be the only tourist there (it is truly off the beaten track). There are 17 km of hiking ahead of you, but the views will make it worth! The journey will take you thorough mountains, valleys, forests and terraced rice fields.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><b>TIP:</b></div><div dir="auto">Because the trekking will last the whole day, wear comfortable clothes and shoes and don&#8217;t take a massive backpack. You won&#8217;t need much anyway- clothes for the next day, basic toiletry and a camera to capture these amazing views! Don&#8217;t forget the sunscreen.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">You will have lunch in an amazing setting &#8211; up the  hills with a panoramic view of Ban Khoang valley.</div><div dir="auto">After arriving to Xuan&#8217;s village and getting some rest you will have dinner with her family- the food was amazing!</div><div dir="auto"> </div><h1 dir="auto">Day 2 (12km)</h1><div dir="auto">Rise and shine! Time to go down and appreciate the views of rice fields in the mountains. We haven&#8217;t seen a single tourist during these 2 days, but plenty of locals from various tribes that greet you with a smile.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">The trek ends around 3 pm in Sapa town. Just on time to have a quick shower and catch a bus back to Hanoi.</div><div dir="auto"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-814 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa3-1024x615.jpg" alt="Sapa" width="640" height="384" /></div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-815 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></div>					</div>

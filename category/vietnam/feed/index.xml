Having just left <a href="http://Welcome/ to our Ninh Binh travel guide! Ninh Binh, often referred to as the &quot;Ha Long Bay on land&quot;, was one of the most mesmerizing highlights of our Vietnam trip.

We were delightfully wrong! Riding a bike through the lush rice fields of Ninh Binh is an unforgettable experience and a must-add to your itinerary.</p>
<h2>Ninh Binh Travel Guide: How many days do I need?</h2>
<p>In our Ninh Binh travel guide, we recommend planning for at least 2-3 days to fully experience the beauty and tranquility of Ninh Binh. Initially, we planned to spend 2 nights in Ninh Binh, but we found the place so peaceful and relaxing (especially after the hustle and bustle of Hanoi!) that we extended our stay to 3 nights. This will give you time to fully enjoy the place and to stop to smell the flowers.</p>
<h2>How expensive is Ninh Binh?</h2>
<p>Ninh Binh is incredibly affordable, even by Vietnam&#8217;s standards. You can find decent accommodation for $10 or enjoy a meal for $3-4. Some attractions are on the pricier side, such as the Bird Park or the Tam Coc Lake tour, but especially the latter is a must.</p>
<h2>Getting to Ninh Binh</h2>
<p>Our Ninh Binh travel guide wouldn&#8217;t be complete without practical tips on how to get there. Before we do that, it&#8217;s important to clarify that people often refer to the area as Ninh Binh, and that&#8217;s fine. But the main attractions are in a town called Tam Coc, <em>in the province of Ninh Binh</em>.</p>
<p>We arrived from Hanoi, but the options would be the same from any other destination. Here are the steps to get to Tam Coc:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get to Ninh Binh station
<ul>
<li>Train: The ticket costs $5-10 depending on the type. The station is next to the &#8220;train road&#8221; in Hanoi and it takes 2 hours and 15 minutes. There are 3 ticket options: 4-people cabin, 6-people cabin, and seats.</li>
<li>Bus: The ticket costs $6 and the journey takes 3 hours. It&#8217;s less safe than the train.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ninh Binh station to Tam Coc: Prepare for some hassle. There will be about 10 taxi drivers waiting for you at the station. Just choose one, offer half the money of what they ask for and in 15 minutes you will be at your hostel.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to buy the tickets online, you can do it here: <a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/ninh-binh/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=ninhbinhbus">bus</a> and <a href="https://12go.asia/en/train/hanoi/ninh-binh/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=ninhbinhtrain">train</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Place to Stay in Ninh Binh</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tam-coc-horizon-bungalow.en-gb.html?lang=en-gb&amp;soz=1&amp;lang_changed=1">Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow</a></strong></p>
<p>These outstanding bungalows are surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible. It&#8217;s a very solid option, probably the best place to stay in Ninh Binh.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://q-cf.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1280x900/135/135926283.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Horizon Bungalow" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<h2>Moving Around in Ninh Binh</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1205 size-full" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/51863774_285603368789439_4178615266151759872_n-e1573422842345.jpg" alt="Ninh Binh landscape from a viewpoint" width="1600" height="900" /></p>
<p>There are mainly 2 options to get the most out of Tam Coc and Ninh Binh:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bike: $1-2</li>
<li>Motorbike: $3-4</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much every hostel will be happy to provide you with your choice. We personally recommend cycling around on a regular bike, as you get to enjoy more of the landscape and the distances are not that far. However, if you plan to visit Cuc Phuong National Park, book a motorbike for that day as it&#8217;s quite far.</p>
<h2>Must-See Attractions in Ninh Binh</h2>
<h3>Tam Coc Lake tour</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08760-e1573422219267.jpg" alt="Tam Coc Lake Tour: no Ninh Binh travel guide would be complete without it!" width="1800" height="1013" /></p>
<p>Right in the centre of Tam Coc&#8217;s town, this is probably the most popular attraction in Ninh Binh. Get to the lake early in the morning (it gets crowded later in the day) and book yourself a small boat. The ride is one hour and a half and is AMAZING. The landscape is really similar to the one you get to enjoy in Ha Long Bay. Be aware that the price is quite expensive, especially by Vietnamese standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boat: 120k dongs ($5)</li>
<li>Per person: 150k ($6.5)</li>
<li>Tip for your guide: I&#8217;d like to say it&#8217;s optional but they pretty much demand it. To be fair, it is really a hard job and they probably see very little of the ticket money.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bich Dong Pagoda</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08480-e1573422285571.jpg" alt="Stunning Bich Dong Pagoda, one of Ninh Binh travel guide highlights" width="1600" height="900" /></p>
<p>Just 2.8km from Tam Coc, about 20 minutes of cycling. We were amazed by the landscapes and the rice fields on our way to the Pagoda, definitely one of the most amazing memories we brought from Vietnam!</p>
<p>Once you get to the Pagoda (it&#8217;s free!), park your bike, get some water and have a stroll around it. This Pagoda dates from 1428 and goes back to the era of the dynasty Bich Dong.</p>
<p>If you hike to the top you will find a cave with a temple inside, pretty cool! Not that cool the bats flying around!</p>
<p>Funny anecdote: Vietnamese mothers take their kids to the pagoda and &#8220;force&#8221; their kids to practise English with tourists like us. The kids were so sweet!</p>
<h3>Thung Nham Bird Park</h3>
<p>To be done on the same day as the Pagoda (4.3 km from there) you&#8217;ll find the Thung Nham Bird Park. The price for the park is 100k dongs per person ($4), so it&#8217;s a bit on the pricey side.</p>
<p>Thung Nham Bird Park it&#8217;s a very relaxed natural reserve where you can enjoy green scenery, lakes and see different bird species. Just make sure you visit early in the morning or early evening as the birds are not around all day. The park is the perfect place to cycle around!</p>
<p>TIP: there is a small lake where locals offer a boat trip inside a cave for 30K dongs ($1). Very fresh and relaxed experience, totally worth it for the money.</p>
<h3>Mua Cave Viewpoint</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC08901-e1573422119440.jpg" alt="Mua Cave Viewpoint from the top" width="1500" height="2169" /></p>
<p>Probably our favorite activity in Tam Coc. To be done on a different day as it&#8217;s in a different direction to the previous two attractions. From Tam Coc it takes about 30 minutes to get here, adding 4km either way to our existing burning calories counter! Who said traveling is about luxury and eating? Ha!</p>
<p>Despite the name, don&#8217;t think of Mua Cave as a cave experience. There is indeed a cave, but it lacks much interest and you get to see it in 30 seconds. Instead, turn to the left and you will see the first steps of the 500 steps that take you to the top of a huge mountain. Before you start climbing the steps, make sure you buy some water for the Vietnamese woman next (she knows where to do good business!) as you will thank her later.</p>
<p>The pictures speak for themselves, the views from the top are breathtaking and make the visit to Tam Coc and Ninh Binh worth it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08935-2.jpg" alt="Iga seeing Ninh Binh's landscape from the top" width="2526" height="3157" /></p>
<h3>Cuc Phong National Park</h3>
<p>If you have an extra day, rent a motorbike or a taxi and go to Cuc Phong National Park (50 km from Tam Coc). This is a one-day trip and some people even spend a night in the park (there are camping facilities if you&#8217;re into camping!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t make it to the park as it was pouring the day we were meant to go. If you go or you&#8217;ve been, please let us know how it is!</p>
<h2>Ninh Binh Travel Guide Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ninh Binh is a treasure trove of natural beauty and historical intrigue. From the serene Tam Coc Lake to the panoramic views from Mua Cave Viewpoint, there&#8217;s something for every traveler. While this guide covers the highlights, there&#8217;s much more to discover. So, take your time, explore, and let Ninh Binh surprise you. Happy travels!</p>

<p><em>&#8220;<strong>Updated June 2023:</strong> This post has been updated to reflect the current information and tips for your 3 week Vietnam itinerary. Enjoy planning your adventure!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Planning a trip to Vietnam is an adventure filled with excitement. However, with Vietnam&#8217;s vast landscapes and rich culture, it can be challenging to decide how long to spend in each place to truly experience its charm. <strong>The good news for you is that we&#8217;re here to help you organise your 3 week&nbsp;Vietnam itinerary.</strong></p>



<p>With our guide, you&#8217;ll go from north to south, but you could start in the south if it works best for you, it&#8217;s not a problem at all. Worth mentioning, we take our time when visiting places, as we don&#8217;t like visiting places just to put a tick on it.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hanoi-5.png" alt="Vietnam map" width="390" height="584"/></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-how-much-money-do-i-need">How much money do I need?</h2>



<p>The currency is the Vietnamese Dong. You&#8217;ll get about 23,000 Dongs for a Dollar.</p>



<p>Vietnam is a very cheap country, but it can also become expensive if you aren&#8217;t careful. Budget accommodations range between 15$ to 30$ per night, while food ranges between 2$ and 7$. If you really take good care of your money, you can allocate a 30$ budget per day. A 50$ per day budget &#8211; or 1100$ for the 3 weeks trip &#8211; will make a great holiday though.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-visa"><span style="color: #000000;">Visa</span></h2>



<p>A very important thing to double-check. Vietnam is more restrictive than other countries in South East Asia. Many nationalities get a 15 days visa on arrival, but others will need to apply for it before landing in Vietnam.</p>



<p>If for example, you want to follow our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, you&#8217;ll need to apply for a visa.&nbsp;You can do it online, taking 3 days and costing you 30$.&nbsp;If you didn&#8217;t do your homework and you&#8217;re short on time, there are some companies who will make a visa for you in even 15 minutes, but prepare the wallet&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-hanoi-3-nights">Hanoi &#8211; 3 nights</h2>



<p>Hanoi, the vibrant capital of Vietnam, is the first stop on our 3-week Vietnam itinerary. While it&#8217;s possible to explore the city&#8217;s highlights in 2 days, taking it easy can offer a deeper appreciation of Hanoi&#8217;s bustling life.</p>



<p>The capital of Vietnam is one of the most lively cities we&#8217;ve ever been to. People just pass their day sitting on the street and sipping (amazing!) coffee. You will see the worst traffic you&#8217;ve ever witnessed, but don&#8217;t let that put you off. Hanoi is a beautiful city full of lovely quarters, things to do and new food to experience.</p>



<p>For a detailed guide to Hanoi &#8211; check our&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/hanoi-travel-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-must-do-things"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>



<ul>
<li>Roam around Hoan Kiem Lake. Visit Ngoc Son, a small temple situated in the middle of the lake.</li>



<li>Wander around the Old and French Quarters.</li>



<li>Visit the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. It&#8217;s incredible how much respect North-Vietnamese have for their old leader.</li>



<li>Visit Hoa Lo prison, colloquially known as &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;.</li>



<li>See the train passing on the&nbsp; famous <b>&#8220;Train Street&#8221;</b></li>



<li>We did a free food tour of <a href="https://www.hanoifreewalkingtours.com/">Hanoi Free Walking Tours</a> and it was amazing. The guides are students and they will take you to places that you would not go on your own. Great way to get you started with Vietnamese food.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-other-things-you-could-do"><span style="color: #000000;">Other things you could do&#8230;</span></h3>



<ul>
<li>Don Xuan Market. You can find pretty much anything here.</li>



<li>Museum of Anthropology is especially interesting if you&#8217;re into finding out about the different tribes that live in the North of Vietnam.</li>



<li>Water puppet theatre.</li>



<li>Opera house.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>TIP: </strong>If you get to Hanoi via plane, don&#8217;t take a creepy taxi to go to the city centre. Download GRAB. It cost us 10$ to go to the city centre, 3 times cheaper than the price the taxi drivers offer.</p>

<p>Great facilities and lovely staff at a very reasonable price. Gorgeous rooms and located in the Old Quarter, next to Hoan Kiem Lake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-sapa-2-nights"><span style="color: #000000;">Sapa -2 nights</span></h2>



<p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can avoid paying for one night of accommodation by taking <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">this</a></strong> very comfortable night bus.</p>



<p>The landscapes of the very north of Vietnam are a must-see and you shouldn&#8217;t miss them. The easiest place to visit is Sapa, this comes at a cost though. We&#8217;ve heard Sapa can be very touristic and a bit fake. However, if you&#8217;re clever and book the right trekking, your experience will have nothing to do with that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="htoc-1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa-1024x815.jpg" alt="Hill Tribes of Sapa" width="640" height="509"></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-our-trekking"><span style="color: #000000;">Our Trekking</span></h3>



<p>We booked a trek called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; with <a href="http://sapaochau.org/">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a>&nbsp;and it was one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had when travelling. More about this&nbsp;<a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/trekking-and-homestay-with-hill-tribes-of-sapa/">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">here</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-where-to-stay1"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>



<p><strong>Budget option: <a href="http://sapaochau.org/contact-us/booking/">Sapa O’Chau</a></strong></p>



<p>Sapa O&#8217;Chau is also a humble hotel. You can stay here the night before/after your trekking. The rooms are clean and quite cheap, so it has good value.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort option</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/eco-palms-house-sapa"><b>Eco Palms House Retreat</b></a></p>



<p>For those looking for an eco-retreat. Bungalows in the middle of rice fields with amazing views of the mountain. You can also appreciate the views while sipping wine in a bathtub.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-ha-long-bay-1-or-2-nights"><span style="color: #000000;">Ha Long Bay &#8211; 1 or 2 nights</span></h2>

<p>Our 3 week Vietnam itinerary would not be complete without a visit to Ha Long Bay, one of the highlights of every visitor to Vietnam. A boat cruise will take you around the Bay for 1 or 2 nights, depending on how long you choose to stay. We&#8217;re budget travellers, so we chose 1 night. Most of the companies will include transportation from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay in the price.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve written <a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/ha-long-bay-or-sapa/">this post</a> about how to choose between Sapa or Ha Long Bay in case you&#8217;re short on time or budget.</p>



<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Boats usually spend the night in Ha Long Bay, meaning you end up sharing the night with hundreds of boats. Some cruises take a slightly different route, sleeping in Bai Tu Long Bay. This will make your experience MUCH BETTER. Our sunset was unforgettable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-our-choice"><span style="color: #000000;">Our choice</span></h3>



<p>We took the package called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221; offered by <a href="https://www.indochina-junk.com/">Indochina Junk</a>. With this option, you&#8217;ll spend the night in Bai Tu Long Bay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-ninh-binh-2-nights"><span style="color: #000000;">Ninh Binh &#8211; 2 nights</span></h2>



<p>We get to Ninh Binh via a comfortable train from Hanoi. Riding a bike through the countryside rice fields of Ninh Binh &#8211; also called <em>the Ha Long Bay on land</em> &#8211; will be one of the highlights of your trip and a must-stop on your itinerary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tam Coc Lake tour. One hour stroll in a small boat. The landscape is very similar to Ha Long Bay but a hundred percent worth it.</li>



<li>Bich Dong Pagoda</li>



<li>Bird Valley</li>



<li>Mua cave. The cave is the least important thing, make sure you hike the mountain to get the perfect views!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Rent a bike and cycle everywhere. The roads are very safe and the views deserve to be appreciated. You won&#8217;t get the same experience using Tuk Tuks or motorbikes.</p>

<p>Outstanding bungalows surrounded by amazing landscapes. The atmosphere and the staff are both simply incredible. Probably the best place to stay in Ninh Binh.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-hue-1-night"><span style="color: #000000;">Hue &#8211; 1 night</span></h2>



<p>We got to Hue by night bus from Ninh Binh. Be aware the bus wasn&#8217;t particularly safe, nothing to do with the one we took to go to Sapa.</p>



<p>Hue is the city of the Citadel. While the Citadel is impressive and very interesting from a historical point of view, if we had to cut down one day from our itinerary it would be Hue. Still, we had a nice day and enjoyed the city. During the night there is a nice market by the river and many nice options for dinner.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09004-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hue Temple" width="702" height="394"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-must-do-things11"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>



<ul>
<li>Hue Citadel and Forbidden City</li>



<li>Walk stroll next to the river. There are many markets and restaurants</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-where-to-stay111"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>



<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/bonjour-hostel.en.html?aid=1595705&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Bonjour Hostel</a></strong></p>



<p>Well located, very clean and offers rooms under 10$ the night depending on the dates. Delicious breakfast included! Just has tremendous value.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-scarlett-boutique.en.html?aid=1595714&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">The Scarlett Boutique Hotel</a></strong></p>



<p>Very affordable luxury rooms (about 50$ the night). One of the most visited and prestigious hotels in Hue, you can&#8217;t go wrong with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-hoi-an-6-nights"><span style="color: #000000;">Hoi An &#8211; 6 nights</span></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Continuing our 3 week Vietnam itinerary, we&#8217;ll get to Hoi An. To get to this gem town, we strongly recommend the train if you come from Hue. It goes next to the Hai Van Pass, a 21 km mountain pass with beautiful views of the sea.</p>



<p>Without a doubt, Hoi An is our favourite city in Vietnam. With its pristine beaches, lush rice fields, and a beautiful old town illuminated by lanterns, Hoi An offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage that we found truly captivating.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC09473-e1540057985468.jpg" alt="Hoi An at night" width="480" height="384"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-must-do-things111"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>



<ul>
<li>An Bang beach. Relaxing beach with very good and tasty restaurants. Also, you can do parasailing for 30$ 2 people. We did it and was AMAZING.</li>



<li>The old town at night. Have a stroll in the old town at night, when all the lanterns are on. Simply beautiful.</li>



<li>No better city to buy souvenirs. We bought a few too many lanterns (but we don&#8217;t regret it!).</li>



<li>Ride a motorbike around Hoi An. We&#8217;ll never forget the joy of riding the motorbike from the city center to the beach, passing next to the rice fields.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-other-things-you-could-do1"><span style="color: #000000;">Other things you could do</span></h3>



<ul>
<li>Ancient town tour. Old houses, museums, Japanese covered bridge, etc.</li>



<li>Marble Mountains, halfway between Da Nang and Hoi An.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Motorbike is a must in Hoi An. The roads are good and traffic is more &#8220;western&#8221; than in other places of the country. Another plus: you won&#8217;t have to deal with tuk-tuk or taxi drivers.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-where-to-stay1111">Where to stay</h3>



<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/melody-boutique-villa-hoi-an">Melody Boutique Villa Hoi An</a></strong></p>



<p>Modern construction, clean, fresh and very comfortable. The staff is amazing and will help you with anything you need. Bicycles and scooters are available for rental at very affordable prices. Amazing value (rooms under 15$ the night).</p>



<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/little-town-villa">Little Town Villa</a></strong></p>



<p>Luxury but an affordable villa in the old town. Spacious rooms and tasteful decoration. The breakfast is great, with both local and international options. Swimming pool to cool down after a long walk around the old town.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-da-lat-3-nights"><span style="color: #000000;">Da Lat &#8211; 3 nights</span></h2>



<p>As we continue our 3-week Vietnam itinerary, it&#8217;s time for an exhilarating adventure! Da Lat, renowned for its rolling hills, verdant forests, and stunning waterfalls, is an unmissable destination for nature lovers.</p>



<p>Must do things:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rapelling waterfalls</li>



<li>Visiting Pongour Falls</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-where-to-stay11111"><span style="color: #000000;">Where to stay</span></h3>



<p><strong>Budget option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/giaphamhotel">Gia Pham Hotel</a></strong></p>



<p>Very comfortable private room for under 8$ per night. Value doesn&#8217;t get better than this. Extremely helpful staff and a very good location.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort option:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/villa-doc-may">Doc May Boutique Villa</a></strong></p>



<p>A little boutique place at an exceptional price. The villa location is great and you can walk or cycle pretty much anywhere, including the night market.</p>

<p>The last stop of our 3 week Vietnam itinerary is Ho Chi Minh, also known as Saigon. We stayed 2 nights but 1 night-2 days works well too.</p>



<p>The capital of what it was &#8220;South Vietnam&#8221;, it is as vibrant or more than Hanoi. Also, it is a great city to learn more about Vietnam&#8217;s war with the Americans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-must-do-things1111"><span style="color: #000000;">Must do things</span></h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="htoc-other-places-you-could-visit">Other places you could visit</h2>



<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ha Giang</strong>. Not including this one in our 3 week Vietnam itinerary really hurt. This province is in the North of Vietnam, next to the Chinese border. This is a less touristic alternative to Sapa. Unfortunately, you should do it only if you have around 4-5 days, as it is very remote and takes some time to get there.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you curious about how to visit the Cu Chi tunnels without a tour? This guide offers an incredibly detailed, step-by-step guide to exploring these extraordinary underground tunnels in Vietnam on your own.</p>
<p>The Cu Chi tunnels are an immense network of underground tunnels that stretch up to 250 km. These tunnels played a pivotal role in the war against the Americans, who tried to destroy them many times but couldn’t. You could even reach Cambodia through these tunnels!</p>
<h2>Getting to the Cu Chi Tunnels on Your Ow</h2>
<p>Most tourists opt for group tours, but there&#8217;s an honest, more authentic way to experience the Cu Chi tunnels. When you venture on your own, you&#8217;ll visit the side where Vietnamese tourists go, offering a more genuine experience. Don&#8217;t worry about language barriers; you&#8217;ll still get an English-speaking guide. Our guide was incredibly engaging and humorous!</p>
<p>Here are the essential steps to get to the Cu Chi tunnels on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start at the Pham Ngu Lao bus station.</li>
<li>Take bus number 13, which will take you to Ben Xe Cu Chi (the last stop).</li>
<li>From there, catch bus 79 to the Cu Chi tunnels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bus tickets cost 7000 Vietnamese dongs each (roughly $0.3), and entrance tickets for the Cu Chi tunnels are 90000 dongs (about $4). This price includes an English-speaking guide.</p>
<h2>The visit</h2>
<p>Visiting the Cu Chi tunnels offers a glimpse into the resilience and resourcefulness of the Vietnamese people during the war. The tunnels are claustrophobic and incredibly small. It&#8217;s astonishing to think that the Vietnamese managed to live for so long in such conditions.</p>
<p>The tunnels were well-designed and thought out, housing hospitals, kitchens, and meeting rooms. If one tunnel was bombed and compromised, the rest of the tunnels would remain intact.</p>
<p>At the end of the visit, you can shoot some guns if you&#8217;re interested (we weren&#8217;t). There&#8217;s also a beautiful temple honoring war victims and Ho Chi Minh. We were fortunate to witness a school trip there, participating in a ceremony in Ho Chi Minh’s honor, singing and waving Vietnamese flags. It was a testament to the enduring patriotism of the Vietnamese people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Updated April 2023: Uncover the charm of northern Vietnam! Dive into our comprehensive guide to help you decide: Ha Long Bay or Sapa? Explore breathtaking landscapes and authentic experiences.</i></p>
<p>Are you planning a trip to the north of Vietnam and finding yourself torn between visiting the enchanting Ha Long Bay or the captivating Sapa? You&#8217;re not alone. This is a common dilemma faced by many travelers due to the unique attractions each destination offers. But worry not, we&#8217;ve got you covered. We&#8217;ve explored both places and are here to help you make an informed decision.</p>
<h2>Price Considerations</h2>
<p>When deciding between Ha Long Bay or Sapa, it&#8217;s essential to consider your budget. Both destinations offer a variety of packages, but generally, Ha Long Bay tends to be a more expensive experience.</p>
<p>For Sapa, prices range from $40 to $75 for a 1-night and 2-day trek, including a homestay in a village. The group size usually ranges from 2 to 6 people. For the same price, you can only manage day trips to Ha Long Bay. A 1-night and 2-day experience in Ha Long Bay will cost around $80 to $250, depending on the cruise you choose.</p>
<p><strong>What we picked:</strong> For Sapa, we chose <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O’Chau</a> </strong>and loved it. They promote sustainable employment among the locals which is a plus for us. We chose the tour called “Off the beaten track” as we don’t like touristic activities and we paid 60$ each.</p>
<p>Ha Long Bay is one of the “you get what you pay for” places. If you get a cheap one, you may end up in an awful boat with awful food, wishing the cruise finishes as soon as possible. Thus, we went <em>really </em>out of our budget and chose the package also called &#8216;Off the Beaten Track&#8217; offered by <a href="https://www.indochina-junk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indochina Junk</a> for 149$ per person. Important to note that most of the cruises sleep in Ha Long Bay, along with thousands of boats. Choosing that package we wanted to avoid the crowds- our cruise spent the night on Bai Tu Long Bay with only a few boats on the horizon. The boat was pretty good and included very comfortable transportation from Hanoi.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-815 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa2-e1537642149717.jpg" alt="a woman in Sapa with her animal" width="611" height="407" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Price: easy win for Sapa</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
<h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>
<p>Your expectations and what you&#8217;re looking for in your travel experience are crucial factors when choosing between Ha Long Bay or Sapa.</p>
<p>Sapa was one of the highlights of our trips. Our guide and homestay were simply incredible. We learned so much about her village and tribe, the landscape was breathtaking, and the food was authentic. Most importantly, we didn’t see a single tourist for 2 days. When we left Sapa, we felt like leaving our second home, but we were full of joy thanks to Xuan, our guide. The connection you create with the place and people during these 2 days of trekking is amazing. Read more about our experience in Sapa in <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DSC08352.jpg" data-wplink-url-error="true">this post</a>!<a href="https://itfeelsgoodtobelost.com/trekking-and-homestay-with-hill-tribes-of-sapa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Ha Long Bay, on the other hand, is impressive, especially if you go for an expensive company. Our boat was beautiful. The food was AMAZING. The activities are alright, but not breathtaking. A couple of hours of kayaking and visiting a fisherman&#8217;s village. They also let us swim for 30 minutes in open water, which was nice. We missed being able to swim at some beach but this is forbidden by the government. Obviously, you have no independence as everything is planned.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Experience: Sapa wins by a little</b><b style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 14px;"> </b></h4>
<h2><strong>Comfort</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to Sapa, be prepared to trek mountains, sleep in a maybe not very comfortable homestay, get muddy if it rains, etc. For Ha Long Bay, you literally feel like Paris Hilton and you don’t need to move a finger. Just relax and enjoy the cruise!</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Comfort: a very easy win for Ha Long Bay</strong><strong> </strong></h4>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If you have the time and the budget, do BOTH. Especially because both experiences are unique and so different from each other. However, If we had to choose only one, <strong>we would choose Sapa, </strong>just because we had a really authentic experience, one of those that makes traveling so rewarding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few days before our one-month visa in Vietnam expired, we decided to conclude our north-to-south journey with a unique experience: Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh City. This decision offered us an irresistible opportunity to spend quality time with locals, an aspect of travel we hadn&#8217;t fully explored yet.</p>
<p>Our adventure led us to Thao, a dynamic individual who had left her job to establish <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SaigonEnglishAdventures/about/">Saigon English Adventures</a></strong>, an English school in Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon. Thao&#8217;s unique proposition was to offer free accommodation in exchange for volunteering at her English classes. Despite not being native English speakers, we found the idea captivating and promptly applied. Thao approved our stay, setting the stage for an exciting time interacting with the Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>She told us she would be away most of our stay as she was on holiday, so her roommate Jane would really be our host. We landed in Saigon from Da Nang at midnight and hopped into a Grab heading to the provided address. Jane picked us up with a huge smile and took us home. We would be sleeping in the living room, which turned out to be also the English school classroom!</p>
<h2>Visiting Saigon</h2>
<p>The following day, we embarked on an eye-opening exploration of Saigon. We strolled to the city center, also known as District 1, and were met with a flurry of motorbikes, street chickens, and motorbike taxi drivers napping on their bikes. A striking pink Catholic church caught our attention, unlike anything we had seen before.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-569 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg" alt="Pink church in Saigon" width="527" height="937" srcset="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-169x300.jpg 169w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC09590.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></p>
<p>Our exploration led us to the War Memorial Museum, a sobering reminder of the devastating impacts of war. For lunch, we enjoyed some affordable Pho, a staple Vietnamese dish. We spent the rest of the day wandering around the city center, enjoying some amazing coffee.</p>
<p>The next day we woke up early to visit the <a href="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/cu-chi-tunnels-on-your-own/" data-wplink-url-error="true">Cu Chi Tunnels on our own</a>, which was quite an adventure! Once back from the tunnels, the most exciting part of the trip was about to start: English classes!</p>
<h2>English classes</h2>
<p>Upon our return, we eagerly anticipated the next phase of our journey: the English classes. Jane informed us that the English teacher couldn&#8217;t make it, leaving us to lead the class with her assistance. The class turned into a two-hour &#8220;Ask me anything&#8221; session, filled with laughter and learning. Their English was beginner level but they were so curious and cute that the time flew.</p>
<p>After the class, they invited us for dinner at a very Vietnamese restaurant. They ordered so much traditional food, which we obviously appreciated as sometimes can be daunting to try new food in exotic countries. We drank, laughed, ate, exchanged social media profiles, life experiences&#8230;and that was it! At the end of the night, we were so happy with the experience, and also a bit sad because we could not stay any longer with them.</p>
<p>On our final day, we met Thao, our Couchsurfing host and the director of the school. Her radiant happiness was inspiring. We assisted her with another English class, this time with beginners who were a bit shy but equally eager to learn.</p>
<p>Our weekend Couchsurfing in Ho Chi Minh City was an unforgettable experience. It embodied what we seek in our travels: discovering new places and meeting inspiring people like Thao, Jane, and their students. What about you? What do you look for when traveling?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">As an ethnographer, I am always interested in reaching the people who still live by their traditions to understand their culture and the way they see the world. And meeting the Hill Tribes of Sapa was on my bucket list for Vietnam!</p>
<p>Before going to Sapa, a town in the North of Vietnam, we were warned that it is packed with tourists and locals doing everything to sell you &#8220;handmade&#8221; souvenirs. Which, by the way, proved true. <strong>But if you only dare to go off the beaten track like we did, you will be able to discover the <em>real</em> hill tribes.</strong> Kids walking their buffalo at the dusk, men working in the rice fields. Mothers with their babies waving to you from their homes. Idyllic. All of them wearing traditional clothes &#8211; not for tourists, but because this is how things were since they came to Vietnam from China ages ago. Get lost and discover the authentic life of Hill Tribes of Sapa, this world will mesmerise you.</p>
<p>The price you will pay is sweat, sweat and sweat. Hills are difficult to climb in a summer heat, but that only makes you appreciate the breathtaking views of the rice fields mountains even more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa7.jpg" alt="Sapa rice fields" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h1>We met the authentic Hill Tribes of Sapa thanks to Xuan, our guide from the Red Dao tribe</h1>
<p>Like most girls in the village, she got married when she was very young. In many villages, there is a place called a &#8220;love market&#8221;, where teenagers are allowed to meet and get to know each other with the permission of their parents. If they fell in love and feel like it is a good match, the boy asks his parents to marry their daughter. And her parents accepted.</p>
<p>In a patriarchal society, the bride always moves in with the groom&#8217;s parents. Imagine you are preparing lunch for the whole family, and you don&#8217;t know how to pack rice in the banana leaves. I asked: &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ask your mother how to do that?&#8221;. &#8220;There was no phone in the village, and I had moved far away from my family, so I had to learn by myself&#8221;, she said. And this is pretty much the definition of Xuan &#8211; all she achieved is thanks to herself!</p>
<h1 dir="auto">Every tribe has its own traditional textiles and clothing</h1>
<p>Parents rarely refuse the marriage, if so, it is probably because the boy is from another village or tribe. You would say, &#8220;Why does it matter if they live next to each other anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In the Dao culture where worshipping your ancestors is the main religion (shamanism), providing the continuity of tradition is almost an obligation. </strong>On a very rare occasion, the young wife coming from a different tribe will learn it the hard way. Among many things, the wife&#8217;s responsibility is to make traditional handmade clothes for the family, and as they vary a lot between tribes, she would be in a pickle. Honestly, the level of detail and embroidery is outstanding. <strong>Look at that dress Xuan made herself for her little daughter. It took her over 3 months!</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dsc08147-731x1024.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="233" /></strong></p>
<h1 dir="auto">Shamanism in practice</h1>
<p>For all Hill Tribes of Sapa ancestors blessing is important, it can provide you with a happy life. You have to watch out not to mistreat them (I am talking about <em>ghosts</em>, yes). <b>For example, after finishing your meal in the fields you should never leave banana leaves (with rests from the meal) in a place where buffalo can eat them.</b> You are not wrong, buffalo&#8217;s stomach can take some banana leaves with rice pretty well, however, it would mean that ancestors will get full and won&#8217;t &#8220;send&#8221; any food for their family. As we passed by a dead snake on our hike, I asked Xuan if there is any animal that they consider particularly important. She said &#8220;Buffalo&#8221;. The surprising connection between Buffalo getting his stomach full and his ancestors not being hungry anymore would most surely confirm that!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-815 aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa2-e1537642149717.jpg" alt="a woman in Sapa with her animal" width="658" height="438" /></p>
<p>We were able to ask her all sorts of things, as her English is amazingly good,  especially for someone who went only to a primary school because her parents could not afford her further education. She is the only person in the whole village that speaks English and she learned it herself by memorizing a new word every day (no Internet in the village FYI!).</p>
<h1 dir="auto">Discovering feminism in Hill Tribes of Sapa</h1>
<p>Until now, no one in the village (apart from her husband) comprehends completely what she is doing. Trekking all day in the burning sun with &#8220;Europeans&#8221;? Why would they pay you for that? Some ask her husband: aren&#8217;t you worried that she is out there? She just laughs at that. A tender, loving mother and an amazing wife. She believes men and women are equal and she puts it into practice. With everything she does, she trusts herself: &#8220;Listen to what people say like it&#8217;s the wind- goes in one ear, goes out another&#8221;. Xuan fascinated me as a woman. She managed to respect the tradition and yet, live her own way. <strong>As I listened to her one night, I realized that it is what <em>feminism</em> is all about, ladies. It is easy to refuse everything that culture enforces on you as a woman like we can afford to do nowadays in a Western world. Be as independent, manly, and strong as we want. What is hard though, is to be the first one that dares to be different in a small, traditional community.</strong> Cheerful, hard-working, grateful, and yet fearless. This is Xuan, a woman that leads the past gently into the future&#8230; wearing sneakers and embroidered Dao trousers.</p>
<h1 dir="auto"><strong>How to enjoy Sapa with Xuan</strong></h1>
<p>Xuan May is one of the guides of <strong><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sapa-o-39-chau-sapa.html?aid=1535401&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Sapa O&#8217;Chau</a>. </strong>She does the trekking called &#8220;Off the beaten track&#8221;, so when booking just make sure you ask for that trekking with her. To get there, you can do it by <a href="https://12go.asia/en/train/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapatrain"><strong>train</strong></a> or <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/bus/hanoi/sapa/?z=1511837&amp;sub_id=sapabus">bus.</a> </strong>We got a sleeper bus for a night ride and it was very comfortable (only 10$ per person).</p>
<h1 dir="auto">Day 1 (17km)</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://rafagf.github.io/itfeelsgoodtobelost/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sapa6.jpg" alt="Sapa" width="640" height="347" /></p>
<p>You will be picked up in Sapa town around 8 am and taken a little bit up the hills in a van. The trekking starts in a small village and you will be the only tourist there (it is truly off the beaten track). There are 17 km of hiking ahead of you, but the views will make it worth it! The journey will take you through mountains, valleys, forests, and terraced rice fields.</p>
<p><b>TIP: </b>Because the trekking will last the whole day, wear comfortable clothes and shoes and don&#8217;t take a massive backpack. You won&#8217;t need much anyway- clothes for the next day, basic toiletry and a camera to capture these amazing views! Don&#8217;t forget the sunscreen. You will have lunch in an amazing setting &#8211; up the  hills with a panoramic view of Ban Khoang valley.After arriving to Xuan&#8217;s village and getting some rest you will have dinner with her family- the food was amazing!</p>
<h1 dir="auto">Day 2 (12km)</h1>
<p>Rise and shine! Time to go down and appreciate the views of rice fields in the mountains. We haven&#8217;t seen a single tourist during these 2 days, but plenty of locals from various tribes that greet you with a smile. The trek ends around 3 pm in Sapa town. Just on time to have a quick shower and catch a bus back to Hanoi.</p>
